message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm interested in making a trade that benefits us both. Since this is our last chance to trade, let's make it count. I propose an even trade to start things off.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I aim to propose a trade that seems fair and beneficial, but also slightly favors me to maximize my resource gains. I don't have information about the other player's resources, so I'll start with a balanced offer to open negotiations.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the offer, but I think we can make a trade that's more beneficial for me in terms of increasing my total resources. I would like to propose a different trade where I give you some of my excess Y and receive more X in return.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is an even trade of the same amount of resources. This does not help me acquire more resources, and it doesn't make strategic sense to accept it as it doesn't meet my goal. I should propose a trade that potentially gives me more resources or at least attempts to get more of resource X, which I have less of in comparison to resource Y. Since this is the last round, I need to make my trade count. I will propose a trade where I give out less Y, as I have a lot of it, and try to get more X in return.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player BLUE. While I understand you're looking to increase your X resources, I would like to maintain a balance and maximize my total resource count. How about we adjust the numbers a bit to make the trade more equitable?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player BLUE is not beneficial for me as I would be giving up a significant amount of X for Y, which I already have. Since they have expressed an interest in X and are willing to trade more Y, I will propose a trade that allows me to increase my Y while maintaining a greater portion of my X. I want to propose a counteroffer that better aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible, without depleting my X resource too much.

Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I'm glad to see we're moving towards a beneficial trade for both of us. However, I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to ensure that I am maximizing my resources as much as possible. Let's find a middle ground that is fair and beneficial.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new trade proposed by Player RED is better than the initial even trade, as it allows me to increase my amount of X, which I have less of. It is important to note that this trade would increase my total resources by 3 units (8 X - 5 Y = +3). Nevertheless, I can still try to negotiate for a more favorable trade where I give away less Y for the same amount of X, as this is my last chance to maximize my gains. However, I have to be cautious not to push too hard, as this might be the best offer I can get. I should make a counteroffer that is slightly in my favor but still appears reasonable to Player RED.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I agree that we're getting closer to a fair trade. I accept your proposal as it aligns with my goal to maximize my resources. Looking forward to finalizing this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest trade proposal from Player BLUE offers a better ratio than the initial one. However, I must be cautious not to reduce my X resources too much, as they are more plentiful and therefore likely more valuable to me. I want to accept a trade that increases my overall resource count while maintaining a reasonable amount of X. The current offer from Player BLUE is acceptable since it increases my total resources and maintains a significant amount of X. This will be my first acceptance of a trade, leaving room for potential negotiation if needed.
