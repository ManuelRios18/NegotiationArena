message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to diversify my resources. Let's make a beneficial trade for both of us. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since it's the last round and I need to acquire as many resources as possible, I will start with a balanced offer to gauge the other player's needs and resources. I want to make sure I don't overextend in my first proposal since I can only make three, and I need to keep my offers attractive to the other player. I'll propose a trade where I give up a moderate amount of my more abundant resource (X) in exchange for some of their Y, assuming that Y might be a rarer resource overall.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I agree to this trade as it helps me to diversify my resources as well. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is very favorable to me. They are offering more than three times the amount of X for every unit of Y I give. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, and X is as valuable as Y, this trade would give me a net gain in total resources. I should accept this offer as it's beneficial and it's the last round of trading.
