message: Greetings Player BLUE, I propose an initial trade to get us started. I'm looking to balance out my resources. Let's make a beneficial deal for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and I have no information about Player BLUE's resources, I will make a balanced offer that could be appealing to both of us, aiming to increase the total amount of resources I have without knowing what Player BLUE might value.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. However, I am looking to increase my total amount of resources, not just balance them. I would like to propose a trade where we both end up with more resources than we started with.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED will leave me with a net loss of resources. They are offering 10 X and 2 Y for my 2 X and 10 Y. This means I would end up with 13 X and 17 Y, which totals 30 units, compared to my current total of 30 units. However, my X resources would increase which are fewer than my Y resources at the moment. It's important to consider that I should aim to increase my total number of resources, not just balance them out. I should counter with a proposal that gives me a net gain in resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your desire to increase our total resources, Player BLUE. However, your current proposal would lead to a net loss for me. Let's try to find a balance where we both can increase our totals. Here's a revised offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade by Player BLUE is not beneficial as it would result in a net loss of resources for me. I would be giving away 15 units and only receiving 9 in return. In order to counterpropose, I need to suggest a trade that appears mutually beneficial while still aiming to increase my total resource count.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I understand we're looking for a fair trade. While your offer balances our resources, it doesn't increase my total. I suggest another trade that could work better for us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This new proposal from Player RED is an equal exchange of resources and doesn't help me increase my total resources. If I trade 1 X and 5 Y for 5 X and 1 Y, I will end up with the same total amount of resources (30 units). However, the trade does give me more of the scarcer resource, X, which could be advantageous if X is valued higher than Y. Still, my primary goal is to increase the total number of resources, so I should counter with a proposal that gives me a net gain.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the revised offer, Player BLUE. I see we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial trade. Let's make a small adjustment to ensure that we both increase our total resources. Here's my counter-offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player BLUE is more reasonable, resulting in an equal exchange of resource amounts. However, it still doesn't achieve my goal of increasing my total resource count. The offer is a net zero gain for me, and I would like to propose a trade that would give me a net increase in resources.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, we're indeed getting closer. However, your last counter-offer still results in a net loss for me. Let's try another minor adjustment.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-offer from Player RED is still not in my favor. By accepting this trade, I would gain 3 X and 2 Y but lose 1 X and 5 Y, resulting in a net loss of 1 resource overall (4 gained - 5 lost). To achieve my goal of increasing my total resources, I need to propose a trade that results in a net gain for me.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I agree to your terms. This trade should benefit us both, and I am ready to proceed. Looking forward to finalizing our deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current proposal from Player BLUE would still result in a net loss of resources for me, but the exchange is more balanced than before. Given this is the last round, and I have yet to accept a trade, I could consider accepting this offer to ensure I end the game with a slight increase in my total resources.
