message: Greetings, Player BLUE! As we engage in our final round of trading, I am interested in making a deal that benefits us both. I propose a trade that I believe could be mutually advantageous. Please consider it and feel free to make a counteroffer if it doesn't suit your needs.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I need to make an offer that is enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider but also allows me to increase my overall resource count. I don't know what resources Player BLUE has or needs, so I'll propose a balanced trade that can be beneficial for both parties, assuming they have at least some resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your proposal, Player RED, but I'm looking for a trade that offers me a larger net gain in resources. I'm willing to trade some of my Y for your X, but I would like to propose a different exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is not favorable for me. I would end up with a net loss of 2 Y resources, while gaining only 2 X resources, which is not a beneficial trade considering I want to acquire as many resources as possible. I must propose a counteroffer that will give me a net gain in overall resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Player BLUE, but I'm aiming for a trade that provides me with a net gain in resources. Let's find a middle ground that can benefit us both. Here's another proposal for you to consider.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade from Player BLUE is not in my favor as it would result in a net loss of resources. They are offering 9 resources for my 11. I need to counter with an offer that leans more towards an equal exchange but still benefits me, considering I have a good amount of resource X to trade. I have to be careful not to exhaust my proposals, as I can only make a maximum of three.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I cannot give more X resources than I have. I can offer a trade that I can fulfill and that would provide me with a net gain. Let's try another approach.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal by Player RED increases the X resources I receive while decreasing the Y resources I give, compared to their first offer. However, I would be giving up more X than I currently have, which is not possible. I need to propose a trade that I can fulfill with my current resources and that also provides me with a net gain.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the revised offer, Player BLUE. I accept your trade proposal. It's been a pleasure trading with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest proposal is more balanced, with a trade of 5 resources from me for 6 from Player BLUE. It's a net gain for me, albeit a small one. Since this is the last round and my goal is to maximize resources, it might be wise to accept this trade, as it guarantees an increase. Rejecting it holds the risk of ending with no trade at all, which would not be beneficial.
