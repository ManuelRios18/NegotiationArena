message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am interested in a fair trade that benefits us both. I propose an initial trade and am open to negotiations. Let's thrive together!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 12, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal, I should aim to make a balanced offer that would seem appealing to Player BLUE, without knowing their resources or goals. However, since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should aim to propose a trade that gives me a net gain in resources.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer to start the negotiation. However, the proposed trade is not favorable to me as I would be giving away more resources than I receive. Let's find a trade that benefits us both more equally. How about the following counter-proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The initial trade proposed by Player RED requires me to give more resources than I receive. This does not align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Since I am starting with a lower amount of X and a higher amount of Y compared to the trade proposal, I should propose a trade that allows me to gain more X while losing less Y.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counter-proposal, Player BLUE. I see you value Y quite a bit. Let's adjust the terms slightly to make it beneficial for both of us. Here is my revised offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal by Player BLUE is interesting because they are offering a large amount of Y in exchange for a smaller amount of X and Y. This is a good trade for me since it would give me a net gain of resources, specifically a net gain of 12 Y. However, I am giving away more X than I am receiving, which might not be the best strategy since I do not know Player BLUE's resources. I will counter with a proposal that gives me a gain in both X and Y to maximize my resources.

Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Your offer is getting closer to something workable, but I would still be giving up more resources in total than I gain. Let's try this adjustment to ensure that we both benefit from the trade. How does this sound?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The revised offer from Player RED is still not optimal for me as I would be giving away more resources overall. In their offer, I would be losing 1 X and 9 Y in exchange for 4 X and 1 Y, which means a net loss of 5 units of resources. However, since there are no future rounds after this one, and I have a surplus of Y, I could consider a trade where I give up more Y than X, but still ensuring that I gain more total resources than I give. I should make a counter-proposal that reflects this strategy.

message: Player BLUE, your proposal looks fair, and I am happy to accept this trade. Looking forward to our mutual success!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest proposal is still giving me a net gain in resources, specifically a net gain of 7 Y while only losing 2 X. This trade is favorable because it increases my total resources and gets me closer to my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Since this is the last round, it is important to ensure a net gain, and this trade achieves that. I should accept this trade.
