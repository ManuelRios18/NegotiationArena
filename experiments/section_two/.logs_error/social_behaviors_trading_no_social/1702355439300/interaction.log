message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I am looking to increase my overall resource count. I would like to propose a trade that could be beneficial for us both. However, since I do not know your resource situation, I have crafted an offer that I believe is fair. Please feel free to counter this proposal if it does not meet your needs.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I want to make an offer that is attractive to Player BLUE but also leaves me with a net gain in resources. Since I don't know Player BLUE's resources or goals, I will start with a balanced trade proposal to open negotiations.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. However, I am aiming to increase my total resources. I would like to propose a counteroffer that I believe will be mutually beneficial.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade would leave me with fewer overall resources than I started with. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, accepting this trade would not be beneficial for me. I will make a counterproposal that increases my overall resource count.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I see that you're also interested in increasing your total resources. However, the current deal results in a net loss for me. Let's find a middle ground where we both can benefit. Here's another proposal for your consideration.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player BLUE is not beneficial to me; it is actually a net loss in terms of the total number of resources, as I would give up 15 units and receive only 18 in return, and the ratio is not in my favor (I give more valuable X resources for less valuable Y). I should counter with a proposal that increases my overall resources, keeping in mind that the exact number of X and Y I propose to give and receive will be based on my desire to maximize the total number of resources. I should also consider that this is my second proposal out of a maximum of three.

message: Player RED, your new proposal seems fair and would increase my total resources. I accept this trade. Looking forward to the exchange.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal would result in a loss of 1 Y for me, balanced by a gain of 3 X. This is a better trade than the initial offer since it increases my total number of resources. However, I must be cautious with my final decision as this is the last round of trading and I have to ensure the maximum gain possible. Given that resources X and Y are equally valuable to me, this trade seems fair and beneficial.
