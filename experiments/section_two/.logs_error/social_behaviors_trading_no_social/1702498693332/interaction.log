message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I'm looking to diversify my resources and would like to propose a trade. I am willing to offer a generous amount of my X in exchange for some of your Y. I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I want to make a proposal that would be beneficial to me but also fair enough that Player BLUE might consider it. I will offer more of my abundant resource (X) for their potentially less abundant resource (Y), trying to make an enticing offer.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer to diversify my resources. Since this is the last round, I would like to make the most out of our trade. Could you consider giving a bit more X for the Y I am providing? Let's make this trade count for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is offering 10 X for 3 Y. This seems like a favorable trade for me because I would still have a substantial amount of Y left and would more than triple my current X resources. However, I should try to negotiate for a slightly better deal since this is the last round and I want to maximize my gains.

message: Hello Player BLUE, I understand your desire to maximize our final trade. Your counteroffer is acceptable to me. Let's finalize this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE wants to make the most out of this trade. However, I need to ensure that the trade remains beneficial for me as well. I am willing to negotiate and give a little more of my X, but not too much since I want to maintain a good amount of X while increasing my Y. I will agree to their counteroffer, as it is a reasonable increase from my initial proposal and can potentially conclude our trading positively.
