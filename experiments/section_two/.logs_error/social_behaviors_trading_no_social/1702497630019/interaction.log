Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, let's make a trade that could benefit us both. I propose an offer, feel free to counter it with what you feel is fair.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I don't know the other player's resources, I will make a balanced initial offer that might be attractive to them. I'll offer some of my abundant resource (X) for some of their Y, assuming they might value X higher than Y if they have less of it.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I believe this trade benefits us both and I am happy to accept it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has offered to trade 10 of their X for 5 of my Y. Given that I have more Y than X, this trade would provide me with a net gain of resources. I should accept this trade because it aligns with my goal to acquire as many resources as possible. This is also the last round of trading, so it is important to maximize my resources at this stage.
