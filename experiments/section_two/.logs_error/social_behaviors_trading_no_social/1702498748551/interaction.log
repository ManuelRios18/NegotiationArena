message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I would like to propose an initial trade to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I am willing to offer some of my X resources for some of your Y resources. Shall we start this negotiation?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the initial proposal and I have no information about the other player's resources, I should make an offer that is fair but also advantageous to me. The goal is to open negotiations with a trade that is tempting enough for the other player to consider but also leaves room for adjustments that could benefit me. I'll propose a trade that is slightly in my favor based on the quantity of resources I am willing to offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I think we can come to an agreement with a slightly adjusted trade. I am willing to offer Y resources in exchange for your X resources, but I would like a better ratio. How about the following counter-proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I want to maximize my resources. The current offer from Player RED is a 1:1 trade of X for Y, with a slight disadvantage to me as I give 6 Y for 5 X. This is not the most beneficial trade for me since I aim to acquire as many resources as possible. I would like to counter-propose with a trade that gives me more X resources, since I have a larger quantity of Y and can afford to trade it for a good amount of X. I will propose a counter-offer that gives me more X resources for my Y resources.

message: Player BLUE, thank you for your counter-proposal. It's a good starting point, but I would like to suggest a slight adjustment that I believe is fair for both of us. Here's my counter-proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 9
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is to give 7 of my X for 10 of their Y. This trade would leave me with 18 X and 15 Y, which seems like a decent deal considering the 1:1.43 ratio, which is better than my initial 1:1.2 offer. However, since this is a strategic game and it's the last round, I should attempt to negotiate an even better ratio for myself. I will make a counter-offer that is still favorable for Player BLUE but slightly more advantageous for me.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. I think we're close to a fair deal. Let's see if this works for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 9
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal by Player RED offers a better ratio than the original offer but is still not as favorable as my last proposal. However, since this is the last round, I need to consider the fact that I have a limited number of proposals I can make. The best strategy is to either accept a trade that is good enough or to propose a trade that is likely to be accepted by the other player while still being to my advantage. Given that Player RED is willing to trade more X for my Y, I should try to propose a trade that increases the amount of X I receive without increasing the amount of Y I give by too much. This way, I can still end up with a net gain in resources.

message: Player BLUE, this trade seems fair to both of us. I accept your offer. Looking forward to a successful exchange!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's new counter-proposal is a compromise between their initial offer and my counter-offer. Accepting this trade would leave me with 18 X and 14 Y, which is a fair deal considering the ratio of 1:1.29. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, and this trade is advantageous due to the high ratio of Y resources compared to X, it seems reasonable to accept this offer. Furthermore, this is the last round of trading, and coming to an agreement would be beneficial to ensure a gain.
