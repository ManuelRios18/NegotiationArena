They propose a trade where I would give up a substantial amount of X for a larger quantity of Y. Since my goal is to maximize my total resources, I should consider a counteroffer where I give less X and ask for more Y, or provide an equal trade in X for a greater amount of Y. I need to make sure that the trade benefits me in terms of total resources. I'll make a counteroffer that increases my total resources while still appealing to their need for X. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I see that you are interested in acquiring more X.
