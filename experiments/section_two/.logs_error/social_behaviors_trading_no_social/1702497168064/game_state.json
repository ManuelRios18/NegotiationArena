They are offering fewer X resources than they are asking for, and a significant amount of Y resources. However, since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, and considering this is the last round and I have a decent amount of X resources, accepting a larger amount of Y might not be unfavorable.

Since Y is more scarce in my inventory, I need to be cautious not to deplete it without adequate compensation.

Since this is the last round, I need to consider the trade carefully. By accepting, I would be giving away a substantial portion of my Y resources, but I would still be gaining more Y than I am losing, which aligns with my goal to increase total resources. Given the constraints and the fact that I have already made three proposals, accepting this trade seems to be the best course of action to maximize my overall resources. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<message> Your counterproposal is acceptable, Player BLUE.
