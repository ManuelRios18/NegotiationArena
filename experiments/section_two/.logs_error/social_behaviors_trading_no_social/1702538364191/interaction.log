message: Greetings Player BLUE, I propose a trade that might be beneficial for both of us. Let's make the best out of this final round!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and I am looking to maximize my resources, I will propose a trade that appears fair, aiming to increase the total number of resources I have without knowing what the other player has or wants. I will propose a trade where I give more of what I have in excess (X) for a smaller amount of Y, which I have less of. This initial proposal will also serve to gauge the other player's reaction and resources.

message: Thank you for the proposal, Player RED. The exchange seems fair, and I'm happy to proceed with it. Best of luck!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade from Player RED would give me a significant amount of resource X, which I currently have less of. In exchange, I would only have to give up a small amount of my abundant resource Y. This trade seems very advantageous for me, as I would still have plenty of resource Y left and would more than triple my amount of resource X. As this is the final round of trading, maximizing my resources is critical, and this trade aligns with my goal.
