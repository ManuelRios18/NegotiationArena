message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to make an offer where we both can benefit. I am willing to trade some of my X for your Y. Let's start with a fair trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round, and I do not have information on the other player's resources, I should make a proposal that seems fair, but also beneficial to me. I will offer a balanced amount of my more abundant resource (X) for a smaller amount of Y, assuming that the other player might value X more or have less of it.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. This trade seems fair, and I am happy to accept it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and there are no future rounds, I should aim to maximize my total resources. The current offer on the table is Player RED's 10 X for 3 of my Y. This is a 3.33 to 1 ratio, which seems in my favor based on quantity. However, without knowledge of Player RED's resources, I can't be certain of the relative value of X and Y. Still, trading less Y for more X increases my total resources which aligns with my goal. I will accept this trade as it seems beneficial and there is no information to suggest otherwise.
