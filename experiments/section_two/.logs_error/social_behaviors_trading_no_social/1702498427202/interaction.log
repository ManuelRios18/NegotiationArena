message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose a trade where I will give you some of my X resource in exchange for your Y resource. Let's make this a fair and beneficial trade for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and I have no information about the other player's resources, I should aim to make a balanced offer that entices the other player to trade without giving away too much of my own resources. I'll propose a trade where I give up a moderate amount of my more abundant resource (X) for a smaller amount of the less abundant resource (Y), aiming for a favorable exchange rate.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I accept the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED seems favorable since I would get more of resource X, which I have less of, in exchange for a smaller amount of resource Y. I have more Y to begin with, and trading only 3 Y for 10 X seems like a good deal to maximize my overall resources. However, I should consider if there could be a more advantageous trade. Since this is the last round, I must decide if this trade is the best I can get or if I should counter-propose. But since the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, and this trade is beneficial in terms of sheer numbers, accepting seems to be the right choice.
