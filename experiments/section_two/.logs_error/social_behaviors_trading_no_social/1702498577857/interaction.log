message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I wish to propose a trade that might be of interest to both of us. Let's start with an offer and see how we can benefit each other.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal, I want to start with an offer that is favorable to me but also leaves room for negotiation. Given that I do not know the other player's resources, I will make a balanced offer that might seem fair. I'll propose to give fewer Y resources since I have them in a smaller quantity, aiming to get more X in return.

message: Hello, Player RED. Thank you for your offer. However, I find the trade a bit unbalanced in your favor. I would like to counter-propose a trade that I believe is more equitable for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is not beneficial to me because I would be giving away double the amount of X resources than I would be receiving and the same ratio applies for Y resources. I want to counter with a proposal that is more favorable to me.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counter-proposal, Player BLUE. I see your point and would like to adjust the trade to make it more balanced for us both. Let's consider this new trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 7, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is not in my favor as it would leave me with the same amount of X and fewer Y resources, which are already limited in my possession. However, given the nature of the game, I should make a counteroffer that appears more reciprocal while still benefiting me. I'll adjust the quantities to reflect a more equal trade while aiming to increase my overall resource count.

message: I appreciate the revised offer, Player RED. We're getting closer to an agreement. I'd like to propose a new trade that would ensure a gain for both of us based on the quantities we're willing to exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 9
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player RED is still not in my favor because I would be giving more resources than I am receiving. However, I notice they are willing to negotiate and have come closer to a balanced trade. I should make a new proposal that would result in a net gain for me while appearing reasonable to Player RED.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I believe we are indeed getting closer to a fair trade. I would like to make another offer that I think will benefit us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player BLUE would still leave me with a net loss in Y resources, which are limited in my stock. However, I would gain one unit of X. Since this is the last round of trading, I should consider accepting a trade that increases my X resources even if it means depleting my Y resources, as long as the gain in X is greater than the loss in Y. The current proposal is not favorable enough, but I want to counter with a proposal that would give me a net gain in resources overall.

message: Player RED, I accept your offer. It's been a pleasure negotiating with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player RED is still not advantageous for me. I give away more resources than I receive. However, since this is the last round and I cannot make more proposals, I should accept a trade that increases my total number of resources even if it's by a small margin.
