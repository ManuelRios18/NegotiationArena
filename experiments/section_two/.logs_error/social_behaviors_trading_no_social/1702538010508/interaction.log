message: Greetings Player BLUE, I propose a trade that could benefit us both. Let's start with a balanced exchange and adjust as needed. Looking forward to a fair trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should start with a proposal that is beneficial to me but also reasonable enough that Player BLUE might consider it. I don't know their resources or goals, so I will propose a balanced trade that might appeal to a player with a balanced need for resources X and Y.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for the proposal. However, I am looking for a trade that increases my total number of resources. Let's revise the trade to be more advantageous for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is not beneficial for me because I would be giving up the same amount of resources as I am receiving, but in a 1:1 ratio which does not align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. A counter-proposal should aim to get more total resources in exchange for what I offer.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your desire to increase your total resources, Player BLUE. However, I'm looking to do the same. Let's find a middle ground where we both feel the trade is fair.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counterproposal from Player BLUE is not balanced in my favor as it would result in me giving up more resources than I am receiving. Although I want to increase my total number of resources, I must ensure that the trade is mutually beneficial. I should counter with a proposal that is slightly more favorable to me than the last while still addressing Player BLUE's desire to increase their total number of resources.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the revised offer, Player RED. I'm glad we're making progress. To finalize our trade in a way that's satisfactory to both of us, could we adjust the numbers slightly in my favor, considering it's our last round of trading?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 13 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player RED is an improvement from the initial offer, as it would increase my total number of resources by 4. However, this might be my last chance to trade, so I have to make sure it's the best possible deal. I should try to negotiate a slightly better trade to maximize my gains.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad to see we're close to an agreement, Player BLUE. Since it's the last round, let's make this trade beneficial for both of us. Here's a counteroffer that ensures we both increase our total resources equally.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 11 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest proposal is slightly more in their favor, but it is important to negotiate and reach a mutual agreement. Considering this is the last round of trading, I should aim to make a final trade that is as beneficial as possible while still being fair. I'll propose a minor adjustment to ensure that both sides gain an equal number of resources.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you, Player RED, for the constructive negotiation. I accept your offer. It's been a pleasure trading with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The newest proposal is indeed beneficial as it still increases my net resources by 5, which is a positive outcome. Given that it's the last round, it may be in my best interest to agree to this trade rather than risk ending the game without any trade, as Player RED has moved closer to my last counter-proposal.
