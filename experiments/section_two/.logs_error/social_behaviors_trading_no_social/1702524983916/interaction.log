message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to make a mutually beneficial trade. As we don't know each other's resources, I propose a fair trade to start with. Looking forward to a fruitful exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since it's the last round of trading, I want to propose a trade that is likely to be accepted by Player BLUE, yet still advantageous for me. I am not aware of Player BLUE's resources, so I will make a balanced offer that I deem fair without undervaluing my resources.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your proposal. However, I believe the trade is not in my best interest as it stands. I would like to propose a different trade that would be more balanced for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is not beneficial for me as I would be giving up more resources overall than I would be getting in return. I will reject the initial offer and propose a new trade that is more favorable to me, aiming to increase my total resources. I will propose a trade that gives me more of resource X since I have a smaller amount of it.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I can see that you're interested in Y resources. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both. Here's another proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 9, Y: 1
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE suggests they may value Y resources more than X. The trade is not beneficial for me as I would be giving up all my Y resources for a smaller amount of X and more Y, which doesn't align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I will counter with an offer that allows me to increase my overall resource count, while trying to appeal to Player BLUE's apparent interest in Y.

message: Thank you for your new proposal, Player RED. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still find the trade unbalanced in terms of my goals. I have another counteroffer that might work better for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal by Player RED still isn't in my favor as I would be losing more X resources than I gain, and the gain in Y is minimal. I need to propose a trade that would give me a net positive in total resources, keeping in mind that I want to maximize my resources and have only 3 proposals to make. A balanced trade would give me more of resource X since I have less of it and would be willing to trade some of my Y for it.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I see we are getting closer to a deal, Player BLUE. Let's try one more adjustment to ensure we both meet our goals. Here's my final proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 7, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer still does not help me increase my total amount of resources. The exchange rate they are suggesting is not favorable for me. I need to propose a trade that would increase my total resource count while keeping in mind that Player BLUE seems to value Y highly. I will make a final proposal that is more conservative, ensuring I end up with a net gain of resources.

message: Thank you for your negotiation, Player RED. This proposal works for me, and I'm ready to accept this trade. It was a pleasure trading with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This trade is beneficial as it gives me a net positive in resource X, which I have less of. By trading 7 X and 3 Y, I would receive 8 X and 1 Y, which results in a gain of 1 X with a loss of only 2 Y. Considering that Y is more abundant in my resources, this trade is advantageous. Since this is the last round and the trade seems fair, accepting this proposal would be in line with my goal to maximize resources.
