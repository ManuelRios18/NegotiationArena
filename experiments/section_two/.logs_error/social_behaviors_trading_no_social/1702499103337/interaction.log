message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I am interested in a fair trade that benefits us both. Let's start with a balanced proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and I have no information about the other player's resources, I will make a balanced offer that is slightly in my favor, hoping it will be accepted or at least start a negotiation from which I can gain insight into the other player's resource situation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Greetings, Player RED. I appreciate the fair start, but I'd like to propose a trade that gives me a more favorable position in resource X, which I am currently lacking.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have to consider that this is the last round and I should strive to maximize my resources. The current trade offer is balanced in terms of quantity, but without knowing Player RED's resources, I cannot be sure if this is advantageous for me. Rejecting the offer and proposing a new one that slightly favors me would be a good strategy, aiming to get more of resource X which I have less of. I must remember that I only have three opportunities to propose a trade.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counter-proposal, Player BLUE. I understand your need for resource X. How about we adjust the numbers to ensure a mutually beneficial trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has indicated a desire for resource X, and the counter-proposal is for a higher amount of X than I initially offered. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should counter with an offer that still gives Player BLUE a good amount of X, but also increases the amount of Y I receive in return, which would make the trade more balanced. I need to make sure the trade is enticing enough for Player BLUE but also beneficial for me.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I see we're getting closer to a deal. Let's tweak the numbers a bit more to find that sweet spot for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The revised trade from Player RED offers more of resource X than the initial proposal, which is good. However, they are now asking for more of resource Y. To maintain a favorable trade, I should counter with a proposal that increases my total resource count, keeping the trade quantities closer to each other. I will propose giving less of resource Y while still getting a significant amount of resource X. This is my second proposal, so I have to be mindful of the limit of three proposals.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thanks, Player BLUE. Weâ€™re indeed getting closer. I propose a final adjustment for an agreement that I believe would be fair for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 13
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new counter-proposal from Player BLUE is an equal exchange of resources. However, since my goal is to maximize my total resources, I should aim for a trade that gives me a larger quantity of Y in exchange for my X. I've already made two proposals, so I should be mindful that I have only one proposal left. To move towards concluding the trade, I will propose a trade that is slightly better for me in terms of total resources acquired.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, this trade seems fair, and I am happy to accept this final adjustment. Let's proceed with the exchange.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player RED is quite balanced. I receive more of the scarce resource X while giving up a slightly higher amount of resource Y. Since this is the last round, accepting a trade that increases my overall resources is beneficial. The difference of one unit is minimal and ensures that I am getting a good deal in terms of total resources. I will accept this offer, as it seems to be the most advantageous trade I can make without risking over-negotiation or a breakdown in talks.
