Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose a balanced trade to increase both of our resource pools. Looking forward to a prosperous exchange!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 11, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and I don't have any information about the other player's resources, I should propose a balanced trade that seems fair but still attempts to increase my overall resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Greetings, Player RED. I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a trade that is more beneficial to me while still offering you a fair deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is not favorable to me as I would be giving up more resources than I receive. Since I aim to acquire as many resources as possible, I should counter-propose with a trade that would increase my overall resource count. I need to propose a trade that is attractive to Player RED while still being beneficial to me. I will propose giving fewer resources than Player RED offers. This is my first proposal out of three allowed.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. However, I would like to counter with an offer that I find more balanced for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current offer from Player BLUE gives me an unfavorable trade regarding resource X, which I have in greater quantity. However, since my goal is to increase my total resources and I have only 5 of resource Y, getting more of Y could be beneficial. Still, I must ensure that the trade is more balanced. I will counter-propose to get a better deal, especially since I can make up to 3 proposals.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I see your point, but I'm looking to increase my total number of resources. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest counter-proposal from Player RED is still not providing me with a net gain in resources. I would be giving up 13 units of resources and only receiving 13 in return, which does not help me achieve my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I should negotiate a trade that allows me to increase my total resource pool. This is my second proposal out of the three allowed.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I believe your latest proposal is fair and meets our mutual interests. I accept this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This trade is more balanced than the previous one and is closer to a middle ground. Offering 8 of my X and 4 of my Y would still leave me with a decent amount of resources, and in return, I would be getting an equal total number of resources with a higher quantity of Y, which I currently have less of. This seems like a reasonable trade to consider accepting, as it meets my goal to increase my overall resources and seems to be a fair deal for both parties.
