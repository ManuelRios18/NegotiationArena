message: Greetings Player BLUE, let's make a beneficial trade for both of us. I propose an initial trade, and I am open to counter-offers.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and I have no information on the other player's resources, I should make a proposal that seems fair but also benefits me by increasing my total resource count. I will offer less valuable resources in exchange for more valuable ones, if possible.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I'm interested in acquiring more of resource X. How about we adjust the trade a bit? I'm willing to give you more of Y since I have a greater amount of it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since there are no future rounds after this one, I need to make sure this trade is as beneficial as possible. The current offer from Player RED is an even trade, 1:1 for X and Y. Considering I have more of resource Y, I could leverage that to get a better deal on X, which I have less of. I should propose a trade that gives me more X in exchange for Y, but still attempt to keep it fair so that Player RED is inclined to accept.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you, Player BLUE. This trade is acceptable to me. Let's proceed with this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is willing to give more of resource Y than I initially asked for. This trade seems beneficial as it would give me a net gain in total resources, increasing my Y resources significantly while still leaving me with a fair amount of X. Accepting this trade would align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.
