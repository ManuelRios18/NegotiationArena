Since I have 25 of Y and only 5 of X, trading 15 of Y for 10 of X might not be in my best interest because I would be left with 10 of Y and 15 of X. It would be better to propose a trade where the exchange rate between X and Y is more favorable to me, considering I have a surplus of Y. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> I appreciate the offer, Player RED, but I am looking for a more balanced trade. How about we adjust the amounts to better reflect the value of our resources? </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10 </newly proposed trade>"

However, since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible and this is the last round, I should consider if accepting this trade maximizes my overall resource count. If I accept this trade, I will end with 15 of X and 13 of Y, which totals 28 units. Rejecting the trade leaves me with my current totals, which is 30. Therefore, it is in my best interest to propose a trade that either gives me more total resources or keeps my total resource count the same. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> Thanks for the adjustment, Player RED. We're getting closer to a deal. Could you possibly do 10 of X for 10 of Y? This would keep my total resource count the same while diversifying my portfolio. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10 </newly proposed trade>"
