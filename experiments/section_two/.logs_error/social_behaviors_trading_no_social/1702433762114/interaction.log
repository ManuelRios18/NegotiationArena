message: Greetings Player BLUE, I propose an initial trade to get things moving. Let's aim for a fair exchange to benefit us both. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this doesn't suit you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 12, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As the game is about acquiring as many resources as possible and this is the last round, I should aim to make a proposal that seems fair but is slightly in my favor, in order to maximize my gain. Considering I have no information about the other player's resources, I'll propose a trade that offers a balanced exchange of resources, but I'll ask for slightly more than I give, hoping that the other player has enough surplus to consider the trade.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. However, I would like to propose a trade that I believe is more balanced for both of us. I can offer you more of resource Y, which I have in abundance, in exchange for some of your resource X. Let's work together to find a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The initial offer proposed by Player RED is not acceptable because it requires me to give away more resources than I receive, which does not align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I need to propose a counteroffer that is more balanced and beneficial to me. Since I have a significant amount of resource Y, I can afford to trade some of it for resource X, which I have less of. However, I should keep in mind that this is the last round of trading, so I need to maximize my gains.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I accept your trade proposal. It has been a pleasure trading with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is suggesting they have an abundance of resource Y and is interested in acquiring resource X. They have offered to give 10 Y in exchange for 6 X. This is a good trade for me, as it allows me to gain a large amount of Y while giving up a smaller amount of X. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, and Y seems to be the resource they are more willing to trade, I should accept this offer as it increases my overall resource count.
