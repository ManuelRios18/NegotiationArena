message: Greetings, Player BLUE. Let's make a beneficial trade for both sides. I propose the following exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading, I aim to maximize my resources. Without any knowledge of the other player's resources, I need to make an initial offer that is somewhat balanced but still in my favor to start negotiations. I will propose a trade where I give away more of my abundant resource (X) in exchange for the less abundant one (Y), which I have less of.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I believe this trade is mutually beneficial, and I'm happy to accept it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED seems to be in my favor as I would be getting more of resource X which I have less of, in exchange for a smaller amount of resource Y. As this is the last round, accumulating a larger number of total resources is beneficial. By accepting this trade, I would end the game with 15 units of X and 21 units of Y, which is a net gain of 6 units.
