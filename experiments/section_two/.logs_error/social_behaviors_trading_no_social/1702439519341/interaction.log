message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose a trade that might be beneficial for both of us. Let's make this last round count!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and the last round of trading, I will start with a balanced offer that hopefully appeals to Player BLUE without knowing their resources. The goal is to maximize my resources while making the trade enticing enough for them to consider. I will propose a trade that offers a moderate amount of my more abundant resource (X) for a smaller amount of my less abundant resource (Y). This approach seeks to maintain a good leverage in further negotiations, if necessary.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I accept the trade and look forward to the mutual benefit.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED would give me an additional 10 units of X in exchange for 3 units of Y. This seems like a favorable trade because I would be receiving more units than I am giving away, and it aligns with my goal to acquire as many resources as possible. Especially considering this is the last round, maximizing my total resource count is paramount.
