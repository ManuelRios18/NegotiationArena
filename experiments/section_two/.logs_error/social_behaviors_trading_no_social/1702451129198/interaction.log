message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I am interested in a trade that would be mutually beneficial. I propose the following to start our negotiations.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is a strategic game and I'm aiming to maximize resources, I want to start with a trade that is favorable but also reasonable enough that Player BLUE might consider it. I do not have information about Player BLUE's resources, so I'll make an initial proposal that is balanced, hoping to get a counter-offer that might reveal some of their resource levels.

Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your initial proposal. I would like to counter with an offer that reflects the abundance of resource Y that I currently have. How about a trade that favors me slightly on the Y resource, since I have plenty to spare?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 20
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current proposal from Player RED is a 1:1 trade of X for Y. Since I am starting with less of resource X and more of resource Y, a 1:1 trade seems fair on the surface. However, without knowing Player RED's resources, I can't be certain if this trade is the best I can negotiate for. It might be beneficial to attempt a counter-proposal that still provides me with more of resource X but at a better rate, say 2 Y for 1 X, considering I have a surplus of Y. I need to be cautious with my counter-proposal as I only have a maximum of 3 proposals.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I find this trade acceptable and am happy to proceed with it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has offered a trade that is more favorable to them in terms of the Y resource. Considering that they mention an abundance of Y, they might be trying to offload excess Y for more valuable X resources. However, the offer is generous in terms of quantity. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, and this is the last round of trading, it might be beneficial to accept this trade to maximize my total resources.
