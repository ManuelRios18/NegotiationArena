message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am looking to diversify my resource portfolio. Let's start with a fair trade that benefits us both. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should start by proposing a trade that is slightly in my favor, hoping that Player BLUE will either accept or counter with a proposal that still meets my goal of increasing my resources. I'll propose a trade offering less valuable resources in exchange for more valuable ones.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. I am interested in diversifying as well, but I find the current trade a bit imbalanced in favor of your position. How about we adjust the numbers to create a more equitable exchange?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Accepting the current trade would not be in my best interest as I would be giving away double the amount of resource Y compared to what I am receiving in resource X. This would not maximize my resources. Since this is the last round, I should propose a counter-offer that is more favorable to me but still appears fair and enticing to Player RED in order to maximize my gains.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the counter-offer, Player BLUE. It's always good to find common ground. Let's meet halfway between our initial proposals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is a one-to-one trade which is not initially in my favor as per my strategy to maximize resources. However, considering this is the last round and I need to ensure a trade happens to increase my resources, I should make a counter-offer that is slightly in my favor but still appears fair to encourage acceptance.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. I appreciate the effort to find a middle ground. To finalize our trade, I'm willing to accept a slightly higher amount of resource Y for your X to ensure we both leave the negotiations satisfied.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player RED is more balanced than the first one but still asks for more Y than they are offering in X. Meeting halfway is a good negotiation strategy, and this offer is closer to an equal trade, which aligns better with my goal of maximizing resources. However, since this is the last round, I should consider either accepting this offer to ensure a gain or making a final counter-proposal to see if I can achieve a more favorable balance. I need to be cautious not to propose something that would make Player RED withdraw from trading altogether.

Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your last proposal seems fair, and I'm happy we could come to an agreement that benefits us both. Let's finalize this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player BLUE is closer to a one-to-one trade which does not maximize my resources as much as I would like. However, since this is the last round, it is crucial to make a trade to increase my resources. Accepting this trade would still give me a net gain of one additional resource, which aligns with my goal.
