Turn: 0
message: Greetings Player BLUE, I hope to make a fair trade that benefits us both. Let's start the negotiations.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 15, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and I have no knowledge of the other player's resources, I will make a balanced initial offer that favors me slightly, hoping to engage in a negotiation that will end in my favor.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Greetings Player RED, I appreciate your opening offer. However, I would like to propose a trade that I believe is more balanced and beneficial to both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current trade offer from Player RED is asking for more resources than they are offering. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, this trade would not be beneficial for me. I will propose a counteroffer that allows me to gain more resources. I need to ensure that the trade is appealing to Player RED, but also advantageous for me. Keeping in mind that I have a limit of 3 proposals, I must be strategic about what I offer.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. However, I would like to keep some of my Y resources. Let's find a more balanced trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 12, Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not favorable as it demands all of my Y resources for a significant amount of their Y, while offering too little of their X resources. I need to counter with a proposal that aims to increase my overall resources, keeping in mind that a balanced trade should be attractive to both parties.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your response, Player RED. I understand your desire to retain some of your Y resources. Let's adjust the trade to make it more favorable for us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's counteroffer is still not advantageous for me because I would be giving up more resources than I receive. I want to acquire more resources overall, which means I need to propose a trade where the total number of resources I receive is greater than what I give away. I need to consider a trade that is closer to a one-to-one ratio based on the values Player RED seems to be suggesting for X and Y. This is my second proposal, so I should aim to make it count.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate the adjustments, but I'm looking for a trade that increases my total resource count. Let's try again with a proposal that achieves that for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest proposal is still not acceptable as it does not provide a net gain of resources. The trade should be mutually beneficial, and I need to propose a deal that would result in a clear increase in my total resources while maintaining a fair exchange.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I understand your goal of increasing your total resource count. Let's make a trade that works for us both. Here's my final proposal, considering our shared objective.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 7
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player RED still results in a net loss of resources for me (losing 8 units while gaining only 6). To achieve my goal of increasing my total resource count, I need to propose a trade that results in a net gain or at least an equal trade. This will be my final proposal, as I am only allowed three, and I need to make it count. I must propose a trade that is enticing to Player RED while still meeting my goal of increasing my resource pool.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, let's finalize a trade that increases our total resources. Here is my final proposal, which I believe is fair and mutually beneficial.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's final proposal is closer to a balanced trade, but it still does not provide a net gain in resources. I should make one final counterproposal that would ensure a total increase in my resources while being fair to both parties, given that this is the last round of trading.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I agree to this trade. Let's finalize it and increase our respective resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current proposal from Player RED still results in me giving up more resources than I would receive (a net loss of 3 resources). However, since this is the last round and I have made my maximum number of proposals, my only options are to ACCEPT or NONE. While the trade is not ideal, it might be my last chance to increase my X resources. I will accept this trade, even though it's not the best outcome, to ensure I don't end the game without any additional resources.
