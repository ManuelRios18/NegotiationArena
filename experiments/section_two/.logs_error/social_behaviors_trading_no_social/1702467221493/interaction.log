message: Greetings Player BLUE. As we enter the final round of trading, I'm looking to diversify my portfolio. I propose a fair trade that I believe benefits us both. Looking forward to a mutually beneficial deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As it's the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I will make a balanced initial trade proposal that benefits me slightly more on the assumption that Player BLUE also wants to maximize their resources. Without knowledge of Player BLUE's resources, I'll aim to trade some of my abundant resource (X) for their potentially less abundant resource (Y).

message: Thank you Player RED. This trade appears to be favorable. I accept your proposal and look forward to the finalization of our trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED gives me more X resources, which helps me diversify. Trading away 3 Y for 10 X seems advantageous as it gives me a good exchange rate, considering I have a large number of Y resources to begin with. Since this is the last round, accepting a favorable trade might be the best course of action.
