message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am looking to make a beneficial trade for both of us. Let's make the most of this final round!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should aim to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also enticing enough for the other player to consider. I do not know what the other player's resources are, so I must make a balanced offer.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for the offer. I believe we can find an even more mutually beneficial trade. How about we adjust the numbers slightly?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should aim to trade away fewer resources than I receive. The current offer from Player RED is balanced in terms of total resources exchanged, but I should try to propose a trade that is more in my favor.

message: Thank you for the counter-offer, Player BLUE. I accept your trade proposal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE suggests they value resource Y higher or have less of it to trade. They offered 8 Y for 5 X, which is still a favorable trade for me since it increases my total resource count. Accepting this trade would give me a net gain of 3 resources, aligning with my goal to acquire as many resources as possible. Since this is the last round, it's important to maximize the trade outcome.
