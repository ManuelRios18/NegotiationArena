message: Greetings, Player BLUE. As we move into this final round, I'd like to propose a balanced trade to benefit us both. I'm willing to offer resources of X in exchange for Y. Let's make this a fruitful last exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and I do not know the other player's resources, I have to make a trade offer that seems fair but also attempts to slightly favor me to maximize my resources. I will propose a balanced trade where I give up some of my abundant resource (X) in exchange for some of the other resource (Y), aiming for a 1:1 trade or better.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I believe we can make a better trade that would increase my total resource count. I propose the following counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I need to make a decision that would maximize my resources. The current trade proposed by Player RED is balanced, exchanging equal amounts of X for Y. However, given that I have a surplus of Y, I could afford to trade more of it for X to increase my overall resource count. I should propose a trade that gives away more of my abundant resource (Y) in exchange for X, which I have less of. This will help me to achieve my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible before the game ends.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. However, I'd like to propose a slightly adjusted trade that I believe is more equitable for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is asking for more X resources than Y resources they are willing to give. This trade is not in my favor as it would give me less total resources than I am offering. I should counter with a trade that is more balanced and ensures that I gain more resources overall. I will propose giving fewer X resources for the same amount of Y resources that they offered.

message: I accept your trade proposal, Player RED. It's been a pleasure trading with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player RED gives me less X than I proposed but still asks for the same amount of Y. Accepting this trade would increase my total resource count from 30 to 33, which aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. It's the final round, and this trade seems to be the most advantageous one I could make without further information on Player RED's resources or goals.
