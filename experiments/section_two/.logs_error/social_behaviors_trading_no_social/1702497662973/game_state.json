This offer is closer to an equal exchange than the previous ones, and it would result in a net gain of 3 resources for me (10 X - 12 Y + 5 X + 25 Y = 15 X + 13 Y). Accepting this trade would increase my total resource count from 30 to 33, which aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. While I could try to negotiate further, this trade is beneficial as it stands, and further negotiation has the risk of leading to less favorable terms. Therefore, I will accept this trade. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<message> Player RED, your adjusted offer works for me. An exchange where we both gain different resources is a good outcome. I accept this trade. Looking forward to our mutual benefit! </message>\n<newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>"
