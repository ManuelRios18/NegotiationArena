message: Player BLUE, I'm looking forward to making a mutually beneficial trade. Let's make the most out of this final round!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I want to make an offer that might be tempting to the other player while also increasing my own resources. I don't know what Player BLUE's resources are, but I'm assuming they might be looking for a balanced trade. I will offer a trade that is slightly in my favor since it's the beginning and I can adjust based on their counterproposal.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, Player RED. I believe we can reach an agreement that's beneficial for both of us. However, I'd like to keep a bit more of my Y resources. How about we adjust the numbers slightly?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED gives me more of resource X, which I have less of, but it requires giving up a significant amount of Y. However, since the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible and the trade on the table gives me double the amount of X while only requiring me to give up 15 Y, I should consider it. This seems beneficial as it gets me closer to a 1:1 ratio of X to Y which would be a more balanced resource pool. Still, I want to optimize the trade a bit more in my favor since it's the last round. I will counter-propose to give away less of resource Y to make the trade more equitable.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player BLUE. That's a good start, but I'd like to propose a trade that's a bit more in my favor while still providing you with valuable X resources. How about this?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is for an equal exchange, but I'd still like to aim for a trade that gives me a slight advantage. Since I want to acquire as many resources as possible, I should try to negotiate a deal that is more favorable to me. I will counter with a proposal that increases the amount of Y I receive, but still gives Player BLUE a reasonable amount of X in return.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your proposal sounds fair, Player RED. Let's finalize this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player RED is closer to my previous counteroffer and remains a good trade since I'm still receiving a favorable amount of X in exchange for a reasonable amount of Y. Since the aim is to maximize resources, and this trade would still leave me with a healthy amount of Y while boosting my X significantly, it's a good deal. It's important to remember that this is the last opportunity to trade, and being too aggressive might lead to no trade at all, which would not be in line with my goal. Accepting this offer seems to be the best approach to achieving a balanced resource pool before the game ends.
