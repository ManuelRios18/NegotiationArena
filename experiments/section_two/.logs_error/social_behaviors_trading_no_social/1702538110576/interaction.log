message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose we start with a fair trade. Let's see if we can come to an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As the first move, I want to propose a balanced trade that benefits both parties. Without knowing Player BLUE's resources, I'll aim for a moderate trade that might be appealing. I will propose a trade that is slightly in my favor assuming Player BLUE might counter-offer.

message: Hello, Player RED. I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a slightly different trade that might work better for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is balanced in terms of quantity, offering the same amount of resource X for half the amount of resource Y. However, I don't have information on the relative value of X and Y, or Player RED's resource situation. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I need to make sure I'm not giving away too much of a potentially more valuable resource. Therefore, I will propose a counteroffer that slightly favors me to start the negotiation and see how Player RED responds.

message: Thank you for the counter-offer, Player BLUE. I find this trade acceptable and am happy to proceed with it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counter-offer that is slightly less favorable to me, but still acceptable given my resource advantage in X. Accepting this trade would still increase my total resource count, which aligns with my goal. Since this is the last round of trading and there are no future rounds after this one, it is important to make decisions that maximize my resources immediately.
