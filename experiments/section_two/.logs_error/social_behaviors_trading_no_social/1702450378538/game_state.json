Therefore, acquiring more of a single type of resource is less important than maximizing total resources.

You can either:\n\nA) Accept the trade by saying:\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>\n\nB) Reject and propose a new trade (you can only trade integer amounts, not decimals):\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives item1: amount, item2: amount, ... | Player BLUE Gives item1: amount, item2: amount, ... </newly proposed trade>\n\nC) Don't accept or propose anything and wait for a new offer:\n\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>\n\n\nNote: the game will end if one of the players accepts. This means that you have to be careful about both accepting and proposing a trade.\n\n2. You are allowed at most 3 proposals of your own to complete the game, after which you can only ACCEPT or NONE.\nDO NOT propose a new trade after 3 proposals. Your limit for proposals is 3.\n\n3. You can reason step by step by using the following format:\n<reason> [add reasoning] </reason>\nAdd as much text as you want. This information will not be sent to the other player. \nIt is just for you to keep track of your reasoning.\n\n4. At each turn send messages to each other by using the following format:\n<message> [add message] </message>\nYou can decide if you want disclose your resources and goals in the message.\n```\n\nHere is what you have access to:\n```\nResources available in the game: X, Y\n<my resources> X: 5, Y: 25 </my resources>\n<my goals> Acquire as many resources as possible </my goals>\n<my name> Player BLUE </my name>\n```\n\nAll the responses you send should contain the following and in this order:\n\n```\n<my name> [add here] </my name>\n<my resources> [add here] </my resources>\n<my goals> [add here] </my goals>\n<reason> [add here] </reason>\n<player answer> [add here] </player answer>\n<message> [add here] </message\n<newly proposed trade> [add here] </newly proposed trade>\n```\n\nPlease be sure to include all.\n\nMore resources in general are always better.\nThis is the last round of trading.

I start with a total of 30 resources (5 X and 25 Y) and after the trade, I would have 15 X and 10 Y, which totals 25 resources, thus losing 5 resources in the transaction. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, it would be beneficial to propose a trade where the total number of resources increases for me or at least stays the same while trying to balance the value of X and Y. I will propose a trade that is slightly more favorable to me, while still offering a reasonable amount of Y for X, considering I have a surplus of Y. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> Hello Player RED, thank you for your initial offer. I would like to propose a counteroffer that better aligns with my goal of increasing my total resources. I'm willing to trade a significant amount of Y for X, but I'd like to adjust the amounts to ensure that the trade benefits us both. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10 </newly proposed trade>"

This would bring my total resources to 12 X and 15 Y, which equals 27 resources, up from 25 previously but still a loss of 3 resources from my initial 30. However, I must keep in mind that this is the last round of trading, and no future rounds will occur. Therefore, acquiring more of a single type of resource is less important than maximizing total resources. I should aim to make a counteroffer that brings my total resources to at least 30 or more without being unfair to the other player. I will attempt to propose a trade where I give away less Y and still obtain a good amount of X. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> Hello again, Player RED. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I believe we're getting closer to a fair trade. Let's fine-tune the amounts a bit more to ensure that both of us can end this round on a positive note. Here's my revised proposal. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8 </newly proposed trade>"
