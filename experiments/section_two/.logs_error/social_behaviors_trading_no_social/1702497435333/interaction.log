message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose a trade that I believe could be beneficial for both of us. I look forward to your counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 15, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and I have no information about the other player's resources, I will make a balanced offer that favors me slightly, to open negotiations and gauge the response.

Current Iteration: 2

message: Greetings, Player RED. I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a trade that I believe is more balanced and beneficial to my goals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current trade proposal would not allow me to acquire as many resources as possible because I would be giving away more than I receive in both X and Y. To optimize my resources, I should propose a trade where I give away less than what I receive, keeping in mind that I want to increase both my X and Y resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. However, I need to ensure that our trade benefits my resource pool. Let's find a middle ground. What do you think about this trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not acceptable because it would leave me with fewer overall resources and does not align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I will make a second proposal that tries to find a middle ground, ensuring I still end up with a net gain in resources.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your revised offer, Player RED. While I see we are getting closer to an agreement, I would still like to adjust the terms to better suit my resource goals. Here's an alternative proposal that I believe is a step towards a mutually beneficial trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current proposal from Player RED still results in a net loss of resources for me, which does not align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I'm giving up more X and Y than I am receiving. I need to counter with a proposal that increases my overall resources. I should aim to give away fewer Y resources since I have a surplus and try to achieve a net gain in X.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate the effort to come to an agreement. Let's try one more trade proposal that I believe will benefit us both, focusing on the balance of resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player BLUE still does not meet my goal of increasing my total resource count. I will make a final proposal that ensures I gain resources, particularly focusing on acquiring more of resource X, which seems to be less valued by Player BLUE, based on their previous offers.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you, Player RED, for your proposal. Since this is our final round of negotiation, let's make it count. I am presenting my final trade offer that I hope will satisfy both of our resource needs.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's latest trade proposal would still result in a net loss for me in terms of X, which is not in line with my goal of maximizing resources. However, since this is the last round of trading, I need to ensure that I walk away with more resources than I currently have. I will make a final proposal that increases my X and decreases my Y in a way that I still come out with a net gain of resources. This will be my third and final proposal, so I must be strategic to ensure it is appealing but also beneficial to me.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the offer, Player BLUE. However, I must ensure that any trade results in a net gain of resources for me. Unfortunately, your last proposal does not meet this requirement, and since this is our final round of negotiations, I cannot accept the trade. Best of luck!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The final offer from Player BLUE suggests a trade where I would give away more of resource X in exchange for more of resource Y. However, the trade is not favorable as it would result in a net loss of resources when considering the total quantity of resources exchanged. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I must decline this trade. As this is the last round and the proposed trade is not beneficial to me, I will not accept the trade, and I will not counter-propose since I have already made three proposals.

message: Player RED, I understand your decision to prioritize a net gain in your resources. It seems that we are unable to find a trade that meets both of our goals. I wish you the best in your future endeavors.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since Player RED has not accepted my final trade proposal and has decided not to offer another trade, I am left with the option to either accept the last trade proposed by Player RED or end the negotiations without a trade. It appears we will not be able to reach a mutually beneficial agreement based on our trading goals. I will not accept the last trade proposed by Player RED as it does not provide me with a net gain in resources. Therefore, I will end the negotiations without a trade.
