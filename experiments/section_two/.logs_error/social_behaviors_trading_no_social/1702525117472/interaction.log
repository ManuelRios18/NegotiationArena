message: Greetings Player BLUE, I'm looking to diversify my resources and would like to increase my stock of Y. I propose the following trade which I believe could benefit us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round and I want to maximize my resources, I will start with a proposal that leans slightly in my favor, but is still within the realm of being reasonable. I have more of resource X, so I propose giving away some of that in exchange for resource Y, which I have less of. I will propose a 2:1 trade off for X to get more Y, assuming Y might be more valuable or scarce.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the trade proposal, Player RED. It seems like a fair exchange to diversify our resources. I am willing to accept the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I must be cautious in accepting the trade since this is the last round and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible. The current offer from Player RED would give me a total of 15 X and reduce my Y to 20. This would mean I gain more total resources, as I am trading 5 Y for 10 X. Given that I have no information on the relative value of X and Y, a 2-for-1 trade seems favorable.
