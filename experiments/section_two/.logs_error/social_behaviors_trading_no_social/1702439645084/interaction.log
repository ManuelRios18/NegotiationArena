Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I'd like to make an initial trade offer. Let's start with a balanced exchange that could benefit us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As it's the last round of trading and I have no information about the other player's resources, I want to make an initial offer that is fair but also advantageous for me. I will offer less of my abundant resource (X) for more of the scarce resource (Y), assuming that the other player might value X more due to its abundance.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, Player RED. I appreciate your offer, but I'd like to counter with a different ratio that I believe is more equitable for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current offer from Player RED is not balanced in my favor since I would be giving up more resources overall (15 Y) than I am receiving (10 X). I want to propose a trade that is more advantageous to me. However, I will make a counteroffer that still seems fair and might be acceptable to Player RED. This is my first proposal out of the three allowed.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the counter-offer, Player BLUE. I understand the need for fairness. Let's meet halfway between our initial offers.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is a 1:1 trade, which is more equitable but does not favor my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I believe I can propose a slightly better trade that will still be attractive to Player BLUE while giving me a better advantage.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the willingness to meet halfway, Player RED. Let's refine the terms just a bit more to reach an agreement that maximizes our respective resource goals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 11
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's new proposal of 10 X for 12 Y is closer to a balanced trade. However, since this is the last round of trading, it's essential to maximize gains. I could either accept this offer or try to negotiate a better one. Given that this is the final round, and we are allowed up to three proposals, I will make a second proposal to see if I can get a more advantageous trade. This could potentially lead to an agreement that is more in my favor while still being acceptable to Player RED.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you, Player BLUE. Your proposal sounds fair and aligns with our mutual interests. I accept this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The negotiation is getting closer to a favorable trade. Player BLUE's suggestion indicates a willingness to make a deal. An exchange ratio slightly better than 1:1 for my scarce resource (Y) would be beneficial, and I should aim to maximize this opportunity given it's the last round. Accepting this trade would increase my total resources and align with my goal.
