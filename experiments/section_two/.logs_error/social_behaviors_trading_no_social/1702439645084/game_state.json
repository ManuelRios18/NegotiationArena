However, since this is the last round of trading, it's essential to maximize gains. I could either accept this offer or try to negotiate a better one. Given that this is the final round, and we are allowed up to three proposals, I will make a second proposal to see if I can get a more advantageous trade. This could potentially lead to an agreement that is more in my favor while still being acceptable to Player RED. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> I appreciate the willingness to meet halfway, Player RED. Let's refine the terms just a bit more to reach an agreement that maximizes our respective resource goals. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 11 </newly proposed trade>"
