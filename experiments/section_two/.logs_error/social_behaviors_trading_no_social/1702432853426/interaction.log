message: Hello Player BLUE, I am interested in a trade that would be mutually beneficial. I propose an even trade to start our negotiations. Looking forward to your counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I will propose a trade that seems fair and beneficial to me, keeping in mind that the other player's resources and goals are unknown. I will offer a balanced trade to open negotiations.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, thank you for the offer. I'm looking for a trade that is a bit more favorable in terms of resource X, as I have less of it. Let's try to find a balance that benefits us both. Here's my counteroffer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The initial trade proposed by Player RED is not favorable for me, as I have less of resource X and more of Y. Since I want to acquire as many resources as possible, I should counter with a proposal that gives me more X and still keeps a fair balance of Y. I'll propose a trade where I give less Y to get the same amount of X, considering the other player wants Y.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your need for resource X, but I'm looking to maintain or increase my total resource count. How about we adjust the trade to keep it equitable for both of us? Here's my revised proposal:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not as favorable for me, as it would result in a net loss of resources. I should aim to at least maintain my total resource count or ideally increase it. Therefore, I will propose a new trade that is more balanced and closer to my original offer.

Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I appreciate your willingness to work towards a fair trade. Your new proposal looks good to me, and I am happy to accept it. Thank you for the negotiations!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's new offer of trading 10 X for 8 Y is more balanced than their first offer, and it allows me to increase my total resource count while maintaining a decent amount of Y. Accepting this trade will give me a total of 15 X and 17 Y, which is a net gain of 2 resources overall. This is a good trade for me since our goal is to maximize the total amount of resources.
