message: Greetings Player BLUE, let's make a trade that benefits us both. I propose an even exchange to get things started. Please make a counteroffer if this doesn't work for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I want to make an initial proposal that is fair but also leans slightly in my favor. Given that I have no information about the other player's resources, I will make a balanced offer that might be appealing.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Greetings Player RED, thank you for the proposal. However, I'm looking for a trade that gives us both a chance to increase our total resources. How about this counteroffer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is an even exchange, which does not benefit me in terms of acquiring more resources. Since I want to maximize my resources, I will reject their proposal and counter with an offer that gives me more of one resource while trading away less of another. I need to be careful not to propose something that is too unbalanced, as that could lead to a rejection and a potential loss of negotiating advantage.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. However, I'm looking to increase my total amount of resources without losing too much of either resource. Let's try another approach that might be more mutually beneficial.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE does not align with my goal of maximizing resources because it would result in a net loss of 5 X units in exchange for a gain of 8 Y units. This is a disadvantageous trade for me, considering my current resource distribution. I need to counter with a proposal that is more balanced and aims to increase my total resources without a significant loss of either resource type.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I appreciate the simplicity of your offer. I believe we're getting closer to a fair trade. To reflect the scarcity of my X resources, how about I give you slightly less Y for your X? Here's my counterproposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player RED offers a more straightforward trade, but it still doesn't help me increase my total number of resources. However, the offer is closer to a beneficial trade for me because it involves trading less valuable Y resources for more valuable X resources. Since X is in shorter supply for me, this trade could be seen as advantageous. Nonetheless, I might still be able to negotiate a slightly better deal, given that this is the last round and I still have two proposals left. I will try to adjust the trade to get even more X resources for my Y resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the counteroffer. I understand the scarcity issue, but I'd like to propose a final adjustment to ensure we both feel we're getting a good deal. How does this sound?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal indicates they value their X resources higher than their Y resources, or they have less of them. The current offer is more balanced than the previous one, but I still give away more value than I receive considering the 1:1 trade we started with. However, since this is the last round of trading, I should consider accepting a trade that increases my total resources, even if it's not perfectly balanced. Still, I have room for one more counteroffer to try and maximize my gain.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, your final adjustment seems fair, and I'm happy to accept this deal. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has made a concession by reducing the amount of X they are asking for while still offering a substantial amount of their own X resource. This proposed trade is beneficial as it increases my total resources by adding more of the scarcer resource X, in exchange for a reasonable amount of the more abundant resource Y. Since this is the last round of trading and the trade proposed is in line with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible, it would be strategic to accept this final adjustment.
