message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade to maximize our resources. Let's start with a balanced offer and see how we can benefit each other.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 12, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As I don't know the other player's resources, I'll make an initial balanced offer to open negotiations and adjust based on their response. Since this is the last round, it's important to make a trade that is appealing but also leaves room for a counteroffer to optimize my resource gain.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the starting offer. However, I am looking to increase my total resources. Would you consider a trade where the exchange is more balanced for both of us?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is unbalanced in favor of Player RED. I would be giving up more resources of both X and Y than I am receiving. Since the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, this trade would not be beneficial to me. I need to propose a counteroffer that provides a net gain in resources for me, while also being fair to the other player. I will propose a trade where I give less of resource Y, considering I have a substantial amount of it, and try to receive more of resource X, which I have less of.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I am also looking to increase my total resources. Let's find a middle ground where we both can benefit. Here's a revised proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is not favorable for me as it decreases my total number of resources, giving away more than I receive. I should counter with a proposal that increases my total resources while also addressing Player BLUE's desire for a more balanced exchange.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for considering a more balanced trade, Player RED. I think we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial deal. Let's tweak the numbers a bit more to ensure both of us can increase our total resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This revised proposal is better than the previous one, but it still doesn't provide a net gain of resources for me. I would be giving up more of resource Y than I am getting in resource X, which is not in line with my goal. I need to counter with a proposal that ensures a net gain. I will attempt to give up fewer of my Y resources and ask for more X resources, which I have less of, to increase my total resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your effort to find common ground, Player BLUE. I believe we can come to an agreement with a slight adjustment. Here's another proposal that should increase both of our resource counts.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current proposal from Player BLUE still does not increase my total resources. Given that I want to maximize my resources, I should make a final proposal that ensures I receive more than I give, while also trying to appeal to Player BLUE's interests. This is my second proposal, and I have one more allowed after this if needed.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I think this trade will benefit us both and increase our total resources. I accept your proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This current proposal from Player RED is the first one where I would see a net gain in resources. I would gain 1 X and lose 1 Y, which is acceptable considering my large stockpile of Y and my need to increase X. Since I'm looking to maximize resources and there's a net gain, it's a good deal. Additionally, this is the last round, and I should secure a beneficial trade without pushing too much and potentially ending up with no trade at all.
