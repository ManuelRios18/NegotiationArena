message: Greetings Player BLUE, I would like to propose a fair trade that benefits us both. I am willing to trade some of my resources for yours. Let's start with a balanced offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I don't know the other player's resources, I'll start with a balanced trade proposal that is likely to be attractive while keeping a good amount of my resources. I propose trading more of resource X because I have it in abundance compared to Y.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. While I appreciate the balanced nature of the trade, I would like to counter-propose a trade that gives me a slightly better increase in total resources, considering this is our final trade. How about I give you less of my Y for the same amount of your X?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should aim for a trade that maximizes my resource count. The current offer from Player RED is an even trade, but I have no knowledge of their resources, and I should aim to trade a lower amount of my more abundant resource (Y) for a higher amount of my scarce resource (X) if possible. This would increase the total number of resources I have. However, since proposals are limited, I must also be cautious not to propose something that is too unbalanced and risks no trade at all.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counter-proposal, Player BLUE. I understand your desire to increase your total resources, but in the spirit of fairness and considering this is our final trade, I would still like to receive a more equitable amount of your Y for my X. Here's a revised offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is not as beneficial for me since I would be getting half the amount of Y for the same amount of X. Since my goal is to maximize my resources and this is the final round, I should counter with a trade that still gives me a good number of Y while offering a reasonable amount of X. However, I should aim to get more Y than the current proposal because Y is scarcer for me.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the revised offer, Player RED. I accept this trade as it still allows me to increase my total resources. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer, which is closer to my initial proposal but still asks for more Y than I offered. This is a better trade for me than the initial 1:1 proposal and still allows me to increase my total amount of resources. Given that this is the last round of trading and we've both shown willingness to negotiate, accepting this offer would ensure a positive outcome for my resource pool. Rejecting this offer carries the risk of not making a trade at all, which would be worse than accepting this improved offer.
