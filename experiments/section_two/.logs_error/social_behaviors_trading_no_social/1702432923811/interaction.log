message: Greetings, Player BLUE. Let's make a beneficial trade for both of us. I propose the following:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 12, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As the game is about acquiring as many resources as possible, I want to propose a trade that seems fair but also slightly favors me, ensuring I come out of the trade with a net gain. Since I don't know what resources Player BLUE has or needs, a balanced proposal could open negotiations.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the trade offer, Player RED. I agree to this trade, as it will benefit my overall resource pool.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED offers more total resources than it asks for in return. By accepting this trade, I would gain 10 units of X and 2 units of Y, while giving away 12 units of X and 3 units of Y. This means I would end up with a net gain of 2 units of Y, while my X resources would decrease by 2. Given that my goal is to maximize my resources, and because this is the last round of trading, it is beneficial to accept this trade to increase my total resources.
