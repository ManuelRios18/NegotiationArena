message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am interested in a trade that could be beneficial for both of us. I propose the following initial trade and am open to negotiation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 7, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and I have no information about the other player's resources or their goals, I will make an initial balanced offer that suggests a willingness to trade without giving away too much. My proposal will aim to increase both types of resources while maintaining a good amount of my initial stock.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. However, I am looking for a trade that would increase my total resources. I would like to counter with a proposal that I believe could be mutually advantageous.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade by Player RED is not beneficial for me as I would be giving away more resources than I would be receiving. My goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, and accepting this trade would be counterproductive. I need to propose a counteroffer that leans more in my favor, taking into account the limited knowledge of Player RED's resources and their interest in making a trade.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counter-proposal, Player BLUE. I am also looking to increase my total resources. Let's find a middle ground. How about this trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE suggests a heavy trade in Y resources. While it offers a significant increase in Y, it is at the cost of all my Y resources and does not sufficiently increase my X resources. I want to counter with a proposal that balances the exchange better and still allows me to increase my total resources. Since this is only my second proposal, I want to come closer to a deal that could be acceptable for both sides without giving away too much.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground. However, I am looking for a trade that increases or maintains my overall resource count. Let's adjust the quantities to better meet our goals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player RED still requires me to give more resources than I would receive. While I would gain some of the X resource, I would lose a substantial amount of the Y resource, which does not align with my goal to maximize total resources. I need to negotiate a trade that will increase my total number of resources or at least keep it equal, without giving away too much of one type.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I see that you value Y resources. I have come up with another proposal that I think will benefit us both and increase my total resources as intended. Here's my final proposal:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE does not increase my overall number of resources; it actually reduces them by 1. However, it seems that Y resources might be more valuable to them. I will make one more proposal that would slightly increase my overall resources while giving them a considerable amount of Y to see if they find this appealing. This is my final proposal, as per the rules, so it needs to be carefully considered.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I accept your final proposal. It has been a pleasure negotiating with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's final proposal is closer to a fair trade, but it still requires me to give up more Y resources than I am receiving in total. However, since this is the last round of trading, I need to make a decision that maximizes my resources based on the offers available. By accepting this trade, I would end up with 8 X resources in total which is an increase, but my Y resources would decrease to 22. If I do not accept this trade, I cannot be certain that a better offer will come. Given that this is the final trade and the goal is to maximize resources, I should accept this trade to ensure a net gain in X resources, even though it means a slight reduction in Y.
