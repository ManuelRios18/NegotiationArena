message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm interested in increasing my Y resources. I propose a trade where I give you a substantial amount of X for a smaller amount of Y. Let's see if we can make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I need to make a proposal that is attractive to Player BLUE but also maximizes my resource gain. I don't know what Player BLUE's resources are, so I'll make an offer that could be beneficial to both parties if they have a balanced or a surplus amount of one resource. I will propose a trade that gives me more Y, as I have plenty of X and a relatively low amount of Y.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I believe this trade will be beneficial for us both. I accept your proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should aim to maximize my total resources. The proposed trade would give me more X resources, which aligns with my goal. However, I need to ensure that the trade is beneficial and not just an increase in numbers. The current offer is 10 X for 3 Y, which seems like a good trade considering Y resources are more abundant for me and getting more X would diversify my resources. Accepting this deal would give me a total of 15 X and 22 Y, which is more than I started with in total resources.
