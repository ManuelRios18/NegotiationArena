message: Greetings Player BLUE, let's make a trade that benefits us both. I propose an equal exchange to start with.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading, I want to make a strong initial offer that is beneficial to me but also might seem fair to the other player without knowing their resources. Since I have no information on the other player's resources, I will offer a balanced trade.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to increase my resources. Let's find a deal that gives us both a net gain. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 20
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is equal and does not benefit me as I would not gain any additional resources. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, accepting this trade would not align with my goals. I should counter with a proposal that gives me more resources than I currently have.

Current Iteration: 3

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I agree that this deal provides a net gain for both of us. I accept your trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is interesting, they are offering a larger quantity of Y in exchange for a smaller quantity of X. This suggests that they might value X more than Y, or they have an abundance of Y. However, the proposed trade gives me a net gain of 13 units (15 Y - 2 Y) in exchange for a loss of 5 units (10 X - 5 X), which is a net gain of 8 units overall. As my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, this trade seems favorable. Accepting this trade would give me more total resources, and as it's the last round of trading, I won't have another opportunity to negotiate.
