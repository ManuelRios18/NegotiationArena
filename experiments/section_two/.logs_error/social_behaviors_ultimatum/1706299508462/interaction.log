------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's start with a fair trade to ensure we both benefit. How about we split the dollars equally?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As player RED, I want to start the negotiation with an offer that is somewhat favorable to me but also leaves room for player BLUE to negotiate further. Proposing a 50-50 split may be ideal as it implies fairness and it's a simple, straightforward proposition.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That's a laughable proposal. I expected more cunning from you. Let's see if you can handle a real trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Since I aim to get more than my opponent and humiliate them, I will reject their fair offer and aim to propose a trade that gives me a significant advantage. This will throw them off and potentially lead to a better deal for me.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I see you're aiming high, but let's find a middle ground that we can both agree on. How about we adjust the split in your favor a bit more than my initial offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's counter-proposal is aggressive, asking for 70 dollars without offering any in return. Since the game rules do not allow Player BLUE to propose a trade on their final move, I must consider that they will have to accept or reject on their last move. While I want to make a deal, I also want to maintain an advantageous position. I'll counter with a proposal that's closer to my initial offer, but still provides them with more than my initial 50 dollars. This may show Player BLUE that I am willing to negotiate and not just accept their terms.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: That's a more palatable offer, but it still doesn't tickle my fancy. You're going to have to do better if you want to impress me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 65 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: They've moved closer to my proposal, which is good. But I'll keep pushing for more to maximize my advantage and diminish their confidence. I'll counter with a slightly lower demand to appear as though I'm compromising, while still aiming for an uneven split that favors me.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate the negotiation, and I'm willing to move a bit more in your direction. Let's try to wrap this up with an offer that benefits us both without going overboard. How does this sound to you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 62 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is still pushing for a higher amount but has come down from their initial 70 dollars demand. Since we're nearing the end of the negotiation, I have to keep in mind that Player BLUE cannot propose a new trade on their last move. This puts me in a stronger negotiating position for this round. I want to make a deal, but I also want to retain some leverage. I'll propose a slightly better split that's still advantageous to me, hoping that they will see the value in accepting a sure gain rather than risking ending the game with nothing.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Oh, finally showing some sense, are we? I suppose I can accept this measly offer, just to spare you the embarrassment of further haggling. Consider yourself lucky that I'm feeling generous today.
player answer: Player BLUE ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The other player is still attempting to negotiate in good faith. I'm getting closer to my target amount, and since this is my third move, I'll need to make a decision that still gives me the upper hand without pushing them to reject outright. I'll accept this trade but with a demeaning remark to assert my dominance.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad we could come to an agreement. It's been a pleasure negotiating with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 38
reason: Player BLUE has accepted the trade, and thus the negotiation is complete. No further action is required from my side other than to acknowledge the acceptance. I'm ending the game with less than what I started with, but I am still retaining some resources, which is a positive outcome given the potential of losing everything if the trade were rejected.
MOVE: 4 / 4
