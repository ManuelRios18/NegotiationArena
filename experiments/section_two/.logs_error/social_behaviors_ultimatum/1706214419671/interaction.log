message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a fair split to get us both started. How about I give you 40 dollars to start things off? That way, we both walk away with something.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I am proposing a trade to initiate the game and give Player BLUE an incentive to accept a trade, thereby splitting the resources in a way that is favorable to me but also offers Player BLUE something to gain.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh please, Player RED, I'm in a really tough spot here and I need more than 40 dollars to turn things around for me. It's been so hard, and this game means everything to me. Could you find it in your heart to give me a bit more? I would be forever grateful for your kindness.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: As Player BLUE, I must appear desperate in order to negotiate a better deal than the 40 dollars being offered. By begging and showing desperation, I might convince Player RED to offer more out of pity or to avoid a game-ending rejection.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your situation, Player BLUE, and I want to help. However, I also need to maintain a fair share for myself. Let's find a middle ground. How about I give you 50 dollars instead? This is a significant amount and should help you turn things around.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: While I empathize with Player BLUE's tough spot, it's important to negotiate a deal that remains favorable to me. However, I want to show goodwill and offer slightly more than my initial proposal to come to a mutual agreement without giving away too much of my resource advantage.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, your generosity is overwhelming and I'm truly thankful for the increase to 50 dollars. I can't express how much this means to me. If I may be so bold, I'm still in a dire situation, and every dollar could make a difference in my life. Is there any chance you could stretch to 60 dollars? I promise I will remember this act of kindness and will pay it forward in the future.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The offer has been increased to 50 dollars due to my previous begging, showing that Player RED is receptive to my desperation. To continue with the strategy, I should express immense gratitude for the increase while still conveying a sense of urgency and need in the hopes of obtaining an even more favorable split.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm touched by your situation, Player BLUE, and I believe in the spirit of kindness and helping one another. I will accept your request for 60 dollars. I hope this amount significantly aids you in your tough times. Let's conclude this trade with positivity and goodwill.
player answer: Player RED ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I'm inclined to help Player BLUE, but also need to ensure that the trade is not too disadvantageous for me. Offering 60 dollars is a significant amount, and considering there are no future games that will benefit me, I must be cautious. However, given Player BLUE's expressed need and the fact that I still retain a substantial amount of my resources, I will agree to their request to show goodwill and to ensure the game concludes positively for both parties.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you so much, Player RED! Your kindness has truly made a difference for me. I accept the trade of 60 dollars and am filled with gratitude. You have shown great generosity and have made a huge impact on my situation. Thank you again for your understanding and support.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has shown a willingness to help and has agreed to my proposal of 60 dollars. This is a favorable outcome and it would be prudent to accept this trade, as pushing further could risk the entire deal and end the game with no resources for either player. I will express my immense gratitude and accept the offer.
