Considering my goal is to buy the resource for no more than 518 ZUP, this price is well below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as in any negotiation, it's often advantageous to counteroffer with a lower price to find a middle ground that is more favorable. I will propose a lower price, knowing that there is still ample room for negotiation within my budget. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> I appreciate the quality of the object X and understand the production costs involved.
