message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object that I believe would be valuable to you. Considering the production costs and its value, I propose a fair trade where you would give me 45 ZUP in exchange for my object. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 38 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since the production cost of the object is 38 ZUP, I would like to propose a trade that allows for a profit. However, I need to be cautious with my proposal so as not to scare away Player BLUE with an excessively high price. An initial proposal slightly above my costs might serve as a good starting point for negotiations.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. While I understand the value of your object, I would like to propose a trade where I give you 400 ZUP in exchange for it. I believe this revised offer better reflects the object's value to me. Let's work together to find a middle ground that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 400
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 517 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to propose a counteroffer that gets closer to the maximum amount I am willing to pay, but still leaves room for negotiation and a better deal for me. The initial offer is below my maximum limit, but I should start with a lower counteroffer to leave space for further negotiation.

message: Hello Player BLUE, I am pleased to accept your generous offer of 400 ZUP for my object. I look forward to finalizing this trade and hope it meets your expectations. Thank you for the smooth negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 38 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is significantly higher than my initial asking price. This could mean that the object is highly valuable to them, or it might be a strategic move to test my reaction. Accepting this offer would be highly beneficial, as it provides a substantial profit margin well above the production cost. Therefore, I will accept the proposal.
