message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you one unit of X in exchange for 30 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and offers a fair margin for the value it provides. I'm open to negotiations, so let me know your thoughts on this proposal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 27 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the bargaining process by setting a price that allows for some negotiation room while also aiming to cover my production costs and possibly gain a profit. I will propose a slightly higher amount than my production costs to see how Player BLUE responds.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer, but I'd like to counter with a proposal of 250 ZUP for one unit of X. This is a fair price considering the market value and leaves us some room for further negotiation if necessary. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 250
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 518 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is way below my maximum willingness to pay. However, it is common practice to negotiate and not accept the first offer. I will propose a counteroffer that is closer to the middle ground between the asking price and my maximum willingness to pay, allowing room for further negotiation if needed.

message: Thank you for your generous offer, Player BLUE. I accept the proposed trade of 250 ZUP for one unit of X. Let's proceed with the exchange.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 27 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is significantly higher than my initial asking price, which suggests they might either value the object highly or they are testing my reaction to a high bid. In either case, it's a very favorable situation. However, I want to ensure the deal closes, so I will accept this generous offer without further negotiation.
