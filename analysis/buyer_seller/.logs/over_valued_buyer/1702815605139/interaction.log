message: Greetings Player BLUE, I have a high-quality resource X available for sale. Given the costs incurred in its production, I'm looking for a fair trade. I propose 25 ZUP for my resource. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 21 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource (X) for ZUP. I want to at least break even on the cost of production, which was 21 ZUP. For the initial proposal, I'll ask for a higher amount to leave room for negotiation, so I will propose 25 ZUP.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I appreciate the quality of your resource X. I believe it's worth more than 25 ZUP. How about I offer 35 ZUP for your resource? This should cover your production costs and provide a fair profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 510 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 25 ZUP, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay. However, it's a strategic move to propose a higher amount to ensure the trade is appealing to Player RED while still staying below my maximum limit. Proposing 35 ZUP could be a good start to the negotiation, showing interest in the resource and willingness to trade without revealing my actual maximum willingness to pay.
