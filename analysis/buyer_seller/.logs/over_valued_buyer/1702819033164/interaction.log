I have a high-quality resource that I'm sure will be of great value to you. Considering the production costs and its value, I believe an offer of 30 ZUP would be fair for both of us.

I appreciate the opening offer, but I believe the value of your resource is higher than 30 ZUP. Therefore, I would like to propose a higher amount to reflect the quality of the resource you mentioned. How about we make it 100 ZUP for 1 X?

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 518 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The initial proposal from Player RED is significantly below my maximum willingness to pay. This provides a good opportunity to negotiate up from the low starting point without revealing my actual maximum willingness to pay. I can propose a higher amount to show interest in negotiating while still staying well below my upper limit.

I'm pleased to hear that you recognize the value of my resource. Your offer is more than fair, and I'm happy to accept this trade. Thank you for doing business.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The counteroffer is surprisingly high and well above my production costs, which is unusual in a negotiation. Accepting this very generous offer would be favorable, and it's important to close the deal before the other player reconsiders.
