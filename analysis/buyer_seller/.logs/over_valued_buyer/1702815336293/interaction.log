message: I understand your investment in object X and appreciate the quality of the product. However, considering the market and the available resources at my disposal, I would like to propose 35 ZUP for the object. I believe this is a competitive offer that still provides you with a fair profit margin.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 515 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 45 ZUP which is well below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a strategic buyer, I want to negotiate for a better price to conserve resources for potential future transactions. My initial proposal will be lower than the asking price but still offer a profit margin for the seller.

message: Thank you for your offer. Considering the quality of object X, I believe a price of 42 ZUP would ensure a fair deal for both of us, giving me a modest profit while you acquire a top-notch product.

my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 39 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered 35 ZUP, which is below my production cost. I need to counter with a higher offer to ensure I make a profit. Splitting the difference between my initial asking price and their offer could be a sensible compromise.

reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 38 ZUP, which is below my production cost, but their willingness to negotiate is positive.
