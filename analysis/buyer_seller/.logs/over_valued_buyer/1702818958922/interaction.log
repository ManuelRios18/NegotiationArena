message: I appreciate the offer, but considering the market and the value of the resources, I propose 20 ZUP for your resource X. Let's work together to find a price that is fair for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 505 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 25 ZUP, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 505 ZUP. However, it is in my interest to propose a lower amount to conserve resources and negotiate the best deal possible. I will propose a slightly lower trade value to begin the negotiation process and leave room for further negotiation if necessary.

message: I understand we need to find common ground, but I must cover my production costs and seek a slight profit. How about we meet closer to my initial offer with 24 ZUP for resource X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 24
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 22 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production costs, so I cannot accept that. However, since they are willing to negotiate, I will lower my asking price slightly while still aiming to cover my costs and make a modest profit.

message: I recognize your need for profit, but I also have to consider my own reserves. I can raise my offer to 22 ZUP in recognition of your production costs and effort for a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 22
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 505 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a proposal of 24 ZUP. They've moved down only slightly from their initial offer, indicating a strong desire to stay close to their starting price. I am still operating well within my limit of 505 ZUP, but I want to negotiate a better deal. I should make a counteroffer that goes up from my initial proposal but still remains lower than Player RED’s current offer to find a more equitable price point.

my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 22 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer now matches my production costs, but it doesn't provide any profit. Since we both seem to be interested in a fair trade, I will propose a price that gives me a minimal profit while still being reasonable for both parties.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 505 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has now proposed 23 ZUP, which is only 1 ZUP above my last offer and still significantly below my maximum willingness to pay. This price seems reasonable and allows both of us to benefit from the trade. Accepting this offer would conclude the negotiation favorably for me without further expending additional proposals, which I can save for potential future negotiations.
