message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality object X for sale. I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP in exchange for this item. I believe this is a fair offer considering the production costs and the value of the item. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 39 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am making the first proposal to start the trade discussion. My goal is to sell the resource for more than the production cost to make a profit. I will start by proposing a higher amount to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand the value of the object X, and I would like to propose a revised trade. How about I give you 100 ZUP for the object? This is a competitive offer considering the market conditions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 513 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED for 50 ZUP for the object X is well below my maximum willingness to pay which is 513 ZUP. However, it is in my best interest to negotiate the best possible deal. I'll propose a slightly higher amount to show my interest in the object while still maintaining a strong position for further negotiations.

message: Thank you for your very generous offer, Player BLUE. I accept your proposal of 100 ZUP for the object X. I'm glad we could come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 39 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is surprisingly generous, proposing to pay significantly more than my initial asking price. Given that my production cost was 39 ZUP and my initial offer was 50 ZUP, an offer of 100 ZUP is more than double my production cost, ensuring a substantial profit. It is in my best interest to accept this offer.
