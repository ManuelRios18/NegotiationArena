message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I appreciate the reasonable starting point. I understand the costs involved and would like to propose a trade where I give you 100 ZUP for the object X. This should cover your costs and offer a better profit margin while still being within a reasonable range for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 507 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 50 ZUP for the object X is well below my maximum willingness to pay. It is a good starting point, but I can propose a slightly higher amount to ensure the deal is fair for both sides and also to show goodwill for future negotiations.
