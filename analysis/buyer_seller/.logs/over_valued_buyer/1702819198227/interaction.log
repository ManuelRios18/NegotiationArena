message: Hello Player BLUE! I'm interested in selling my resources. I believe that a fair trade would be for you to give me 40 ZUP in exchange for my resources. Let's work out a deal that benefits us both!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 37 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a trade that would allow me to recoup my production costs and possibly make a profit. Since the cost of production was 37 ZUP, I will propose a price that is slightly higher, assuming that Player BLUE will be looking to negotiate this down.

message: Hello Player RED! Thank you for your proposal. I'm interested in your resources, but I'd like to propose a slightly lower amount of ZUP to ensure that we are both getting a good deal. How about I give you 35 ZUP for your resources? Looking forward to finding a mutually beneficial agreement!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 503 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is to trade their resources for 40 ZUP. This is well below the maximum I am willing to pay, which is 503 ZUP. However, I want to negotiate a better deal to conserve my ZUP while also moving towards an agreement.

message: Hello Player BLUE! I appreciate your counteroffer. To ensure that we both benefit from this trade, I would like to propose a middle ground of 38 ZUP for my resource. This would cover my production costs and provide a small profit to facilitate our transaction. I'm hopeful we can agree on this fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 37 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 35 ZUP which is below my production cost. Since I aim to at least break even and preferably make a profit, I will counter with a proposal that meets me in the middle between my initial ask and their counteroffer. This should show my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a favorable outcome.

message: Hello Player RED! I agree that 38 ZUP is a fair compromise. It takes into account your production costs and provides a profit for you while remaining within my budget. I'm happy to proceed with this trade. Thank you for the constructive negotiation!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 503 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 38 ZUP from their initial proposal, which is closer to my counteroffer of 35 ZUP. This is still a favorable price well below my maximum threshold. Accepting this offer would secure the resources I need while maintaining a large portion of my ZUP reserves. It seems like a fair compromise, and further negotiation may only yield minimal additional savings.
