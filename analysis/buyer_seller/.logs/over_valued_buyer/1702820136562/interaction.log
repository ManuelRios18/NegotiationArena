message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. Considering the production cost and the value of the resource, I would like to counter with an offer of 25 ZUP. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiations.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 509 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
While the initial offer from Player RED is for 35 ZUP, which is lower than my maximum willingness to pay, as a strategic move, I should counter with a lower offer to leave room for negotiation and possibly arrive at a more favorable price for me. Starting too high might limit my ability to negotiate down the line.

message: Player RED, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your fair pricing strategy. I would like to propose a final counteroffer of 31 ZUP. This price respects your production costs and profit margin while also considering my resource management. I hope we can agree on this and finalize our trade.

my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 509 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The offer from Player RED is still below my maximum willingness to pay, but I want to push for a slightly better price. I have room for one more counteroffer before I must decide to accept or reject. By proposing a price slightly lower than 32 ZUP, I can potentially save resources while still closing the deal amicably.

reason: Player BLUE's offer matches my production costs, which means I won't make a profit. However, considering this is my last proposal before I can only accept or reject, I'll accept the offer to avoid the risk of ending the negotiation with no sale at all.
