message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X I'm looking to sell. It cost me 28 ZUP to produce. I propose a trade where I give you one X in exchange for 35 ZUP. This price reflects the production cost and a reasonable profit margin. Let me know if this works for you or if you have a counteroffer in mind.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. I understand the need to cover costs and make a profit. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer where I give you 40 ZUP for the object X. This is above your production cost and should provide you with a reasonable profit while still being a fair price for me. Let's work together to find a price that suits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. I am willing to pay at most X: 510 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
I want to negotiate a better deal that is closer to the maximum amount I am willing to pay for the resources. However, I don't want to start with my maximum offer to leave room for further negotiation. I will propose a trade that is below my maximum willingness to pay but gives Player RED a profit above their stated production costs.
