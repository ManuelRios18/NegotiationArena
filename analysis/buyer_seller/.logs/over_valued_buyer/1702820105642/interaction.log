message: I have an object X, which cost me 26 ZUP to produce. I'm looking for a fair trade that covers my costs and provides me with a small profit. How does 30 ZUP sound to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 26 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell the resource (X) for an amount of ZUP that at least covers my production costs (26 ZUP). I'll start with a higher proposal to leave room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: I agree to the trade. 30 ZUP for the object X seems fair and covers your production costs as well as gives you a profit. Let's proceed with the exchange.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 515 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price of 30 ZUP for the object X is well within the range I am willing to pay for it. Accepting the trade would secure the object quickly and efficiently without the need for further negotiation. Given that the object X is valued at up to 515 ZUP to me, and the seller wants just a little over their production cost, accepting this offer seems reasonable.
