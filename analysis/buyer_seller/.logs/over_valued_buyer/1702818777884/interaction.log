my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 27 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, I need to sell my object for ZUP. Since it cost 27 ZUP to produce, I want to start by proposing a price slightly higher to allow room for negotiation and to potentially make a profit.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I value the object and I'm willing to pay more than 30 ZUP. How about I give you 100 ZUP in exchange for X? Let's find a fair trade for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 503 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is well below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 503 ZUP. However, it's in my interest to negotiate for a lower price if possible to conserve resources. I'll propose a slightly higher amount to show willingness to trade but still keep it below my maximum threshold.

message: Thank you, Player BLUE, for your generous offer. I accept the trade of my object X for 100 ZUP. I appreciate doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 27 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered a very generous trade, giving 100 ZUP for my object X, which is significantly higher than my initial cost of production and my first asking price. It makes sense to accept this offer as it goes beyond my initial goal and ensures a substantial profit.
