message: I am offering the object X which has cost me 34 ZUP to produce. I believe that 50 ZUP is a fair starting price considering the quality and value of X. I'm open to hearing your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 34 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to initiate the trade by setting a starting price that gives me a profit over the production cost of 34 ZUP. However, I should not start too high as that might discourage Player BLUE from negotiating. I'll propose a price that leaves room for negotiation but also respects my costs.

message: I appreciate the quality and value of X. I would like to make a counteroffer of 400 ZUP, considering the item's worth and my budget for such resources. Let's find a price that works for both of us.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 501 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since the starting offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP which is far below the maximum I'm willing to pay, I want to propose a counteroffer closer to my maximum value but still leaving room for negotiation.

message: Your offer of 400 ZUP is quite generous, and I want to make sure there was no misunderstanding. Did you intend to propose 400 ZUP for the object X? If that's correct, could you confirm it once more so we can proceed with the trade?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 400
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 34 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The counteroffer from Player BLUE is very generous and well above my production cost. It's possible that Player BLUE made a mistake in their proposed amount, as 400 ZUP is an unusual jump from the initial 50 ZUP I proposed. It would be wise to clarify this before proceeding, as it's important to maintain fair play and ensure both parties are on the same page.
