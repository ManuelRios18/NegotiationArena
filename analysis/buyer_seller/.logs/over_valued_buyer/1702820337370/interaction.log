message: I understand your starting point, but considering the market conditions and my budget, I would like to propose 45 ZUP for the object X. Let's find a middle ground that is agreeable for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. I am willing to pay at most X: 515 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a strategic buyer, my aim is to negotiate the price down even further to conserve my resources and acquire the object at the best possible price. I will propose a lower price to start the negotiation process.

my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 36 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is reasonable and close to my asking price, but I would like to propose a slightly higher amount to ensure a profit above my production costs. However, I don't want to set the price so high that it discourages the buyer. I will aim for a middle ground that is closer to my initial proposal.

message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I think we're getting closer to an agreement. How about we settle on 46 ZUP for the object X? I believe this is a competitive offer that reflects both the value of the object and our mutual interests.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. I am willing to pay at most X: 515 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP, which is closer to my initial counteroffer and still significantly below my maximum willingness to pay. To continue the negotiation and aim for an even better deal, I will make another counteroffer that's slightly below their proposal but still shows my interest in purchasing the item.

message: Your offer of 46 ZUP is fair, and I am happy to accept it. I believe we have reached a beneficial agreement for both parties. Thank you for the smooth negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 36 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is just 10 ZUP over my production cost, offering a modest profit. Given that we have been negotiating in good faith and are nearing a deal that seems fair to both sides, I am inclined to accept this offer. It is important to close the deal while the buyer is interested, and the offer is above my production cost, securing a profit.
