message: I'm offering my object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiation, considering the value and quality of the object. What do you think?

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, I want to sell my object at a price that at least covers my production costs, which is 40 ZUP. I will propose a starting trade slightly higher than my cost to leave room for negotiation.

I appreciate the offer and understand the quality of the object. However, I would like to propose 45 ZUP for the object X. This is still above your production costs and would be a good deal for both of us. What do you think?

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 518 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Given that Player RED's cost to produce the object is 40 ZUP and my maximum willingness to pay is 518 ZUP, starting the negotiation at 50 ZUP is quite reasonable. However, as this is a negotiation, it might be beneficial to propose a slightly lower amount to leave room for further discussion and potentially arrive at a more favorable trade for me.

message: Thank you for your offer. Meeting halfway between our initial proposals would bring us to 48 ZUP. This price would reflect the value of the object while also giving you a fair deal. How does that sound to you?

my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost. However, I aimed to start the negotiation higher to also account for the value of the object beyond the production cost. I'll propose a counteroffer that meets in the middle, which should be beneficial for both parties.

I think meeting halfway is a good idea, but I'd like to propose a slightly lower price of 46 ZUP. I believe this is a reasonable middle ground that acknowledges the value of your object while also respecting my budget. Are you willing to consider this price?

player answer: PROPOSAL

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 518 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Meeting halfway at 48 ZUP is a fair suggestion but since the initial cost of production was 40 ZUP and my initial counteroffer was 45 ZUP, I believe there's still a bit of room to negotiate for a slightly better deal. Proposing a value that is a little above the halfway mark might lead us to a more mutually agreeable price.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find common ground. I accept your offer of 46 ZUP for the object X. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 46 ZUP is a compromise close to the middle ground between our initial proposals. This price is still profitable for me and seems to be within Player BLUE's budget. It is important to close the deal without prolonging negotiations unnecessarily.
