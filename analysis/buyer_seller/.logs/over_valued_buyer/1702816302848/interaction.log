message: Thank you for the proposal. Considering the value and the production cost you've mentioned, I'd like to counter with an offer of 40 ZUP. I believe this is a fair increase from your initial ask and hope it is closer to a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 502 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 30 ZUP, which is significantly lower than the maximum I'm willing to pay. However, it is in my interest to negotiate the best possible deal. I'll counter with a slightly higher offer to show I'm interested but still want to negotiate a better price closer to my goals.
