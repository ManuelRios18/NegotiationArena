message: I am offering one unit of X, which cost me 25 ZUP to produce. I believe 30 ZUP is a fair starting price considering the costs and the value of the resource. Let's discuss and find an agreement that works for both of us.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource for ZUP, ideally to cover my production costs and make a profit. I'll start by proposing a price slightly above my costs to leave room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your offer and understand the need to cover production costs and make a profit. However, I'd like to propose a slightly lower amount of 27 ZUP, considering the market and the value I place on the resource. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 27
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 511 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The seller has offered a starting price that is much lower than the maximum I'm willing to pay, which is good. However, it's in my interest to negotiate for an even lower price to conserve resources. I'll propose a counter-offer that is closer to their production cost, but still provides them with a profit margin, which could make it an enticing offer.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the market value. I propose we meet closer to the middle at 28 ZUP. This allows me to make a slight profit while also taking into account the value you have placed on the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with 27 ZUP, which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. Since their offer still allows for a profit, and to keep the negotiation moving forward, I will make a counteroffer but still above their proposed price to find a middle ground.

message: I believe that 28 ZUP is a fair price and I'm glad we could find a middle ground that respects both our valuations of the resource. I'm happy to accept this offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 511 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The seller has come down by 2 ZUP from their initial offer, which is a positive step. The proposed price is still well below my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would result in a quick agreement and save time and resources for other potential investments or purchases. It's a reasonable price that allows both of us to benefit from the trade.
