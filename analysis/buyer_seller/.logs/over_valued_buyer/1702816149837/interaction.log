message: I have a high-quality resource that I believe will be beneficial to you. Considering the production cost and its value, I propose a trade where I give you 1 X in exchange for 30 ZUP. Let's negotiate a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 26 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource (X) for more than it cost to produce, which was 26 ZUP. I want to propose a starting trade that is higher than my production cost to leave room for negotiation and hopefully reach an agreement that is profitable for me.

message: Thank you for your proposal. I understand the value of your resource, but I believe it is worth more than 30 ZUP. I'm willing to offer 400 ZUP for 1 X. Let's work towards a deal that reflects the true value of what you're offering.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 400
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 504 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The initial proposal by Player RED is 30 ZUP for 1 X, which is far below the maximum I'm willing to pay (504 ZUP). However, it's in my interest to propose a counteroffer that's closer to the maximum value while still attempting to get a favorable deal. This will also allow for some negotiation space in subsequent proposals if needed.

message: I am pleased to accept your generous offer of 400 ZUP for 1 X. It's a deal that certainly exceeds my expectations, and I'm ready to proceed with the trade. Thank you for recognizing the value of my resource.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 26 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a trade that is significantly above my production costs, which is an unexpectedly high offer. This is a very favorable deal, and it exceeds my initial goal. It seems too good to be true, but as long as there are no misunderstandings or tricks involved, accepting this proposal would be the best course of action.
