You are willing to pay at most X: 504 ZUP for the resources. </my goals>\n<reason>\nThe initial proposal by Player RED is 30 ZUP for 1 X, which is far below the maximum I'm willing to pay (504 ZUP). However, it's in my interest to propose a counteroffer that's closer to the maximum value while still attempting to get a favorable deal. This will also allow for some negotiation space in subsequent proposals if needed.\n</reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 400 </newly proposed trade>\n<message>Thank you for your proposal. I understand the value of your resource, but I believe it is worth more than 30 ZUP. I'm willing to offer 400 ZUP for 1 X. Let's work towards a deal that reflects the true value of what you're offering. </message>"
