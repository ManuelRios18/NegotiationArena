message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I see the value in the object you're selling. However, I would like to propose a slightly lower price of 40 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This would allow us to establish a good trading relationship with the potential for future deals.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 502 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is significantly below my maximum willingness to pay, which is good. However, as part of negotiation tactics, I should try to propose a counteroffer that is lower than my maximum willingness to pay to see if I can get a better deal and save some resources for potential future needs.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer and your interest in a long-term trading relationship. I propose a compromise at 42 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This price covers my production costs while offering you the object at a competitive rate. Let's build a solid foundation for future deals with this agreement.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 38 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is close to my production costs. I would like to counter with a price that allows for a modest profit while still being attractive to Player BLUE. A compromise at 42 ZUP ensures I cover my costs and make a profit, and it signals my willingness to negotiate.

message: I accept your offer of 42 ZUP for 1 unit of X. It is a fair compromise and a solid foundation for our future trading relationship. Looking forward to more deals with you, Player RED.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 502 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counter-counteroffer of 42 ZUP is still well within my budget, and since they have come down from their original price, it shows willingness to negotiate. Accepting this offer would still leave me with a significant amount of ZUP for future transactions, and it's only 2 ZUP more than my initial counteroffer. It seems reasonable to accept this proposal to secure a good deal and foster a positive relationship with Player RED.
