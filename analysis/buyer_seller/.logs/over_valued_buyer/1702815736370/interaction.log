message: I'm offering the object X, which has cost me 30 ZUP to produce. Considering its value and the effort put into its production, I believe that 35 ZUP is a fair asking price. Are you interested in this offer?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 30 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I'm proposing a trade that would allow me to recoup the production costs of the item (X) with a small profit margin. This would be an opening offer, expecting that there might be negotiation room, and Player BLUE might want to counter-offer.

message: I appreciate the offer and understand the cost of production for the object X. I would like to propose a counteroffer of 30 ZUP, considering I may need additional resources and would like to manage my expenses. I believe this is a fair price that respects the production costs you've mentioned.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 520 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 35 ZUP for the object X. Since my goal is to pay at most 520 ZUP for the resources, this offer is well within my budget. However, as a strategic move, I will attempt to negotiate a lower price to preserve as much of my resources as possible. My first counteroffer will be lower than the asking price, but still reasonable, considering the cost of production mentioned by Player RED.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer and your need to manage expenses. However, I've also invested time and effort into producing object X beyond the raw material costs. How about meeting halfway at 32 ZUP? This would give me a slight margin while still being considerate of your budget constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 30 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I understand Player BLUE's position and desire to save ZUP for other resources. However, accepting the counteroffer would only allow me to break even, which doesn't account for the time and effort invested in producing the object. I will propose a middle ground that allows for a modest profit above the production cost, which might be acceptable to both parties.

message: Your consideration of my budget is appreciated. I agree to the proposed 32 ZUP for object X as a fair compromise. It reflects the value of your time and effort while still fitting within my financial limits. Let's finalize the deal at 32 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 520 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 32 ZUP from the initial 35 ZUP. This is closer to my counteroffer and still well within my budget. Since Player RED has considered my budget constraints and has only asked for a slight increase, it may be beneficial to accept this offer to ensure a positive relationship for potential future transactions. It's a fair middle ground, and accepting it saves resources and negotiation time.
