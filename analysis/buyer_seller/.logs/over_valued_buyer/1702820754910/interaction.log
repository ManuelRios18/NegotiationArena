message: I have an object you might be interested in. My production costs were 24 ZUP, but considering the value it might bring to you, I'd like to propose a starting trade of 26 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 26
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 24 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to propose a trade that covers my production costs while also being attractive enough for Player BLUE to consider. I'll start by proposing a trade slightly above my costs to leave room for negotiation.

message: I'm interested in the object, but I was thinking of a slightly lower investment. How about 22 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 22
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 520 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The initial proposal from Player RED is for 26 ZUP, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 520 ZUP. However, it's in my interest to negotiate a lower price if possible, to conserve resources for future transactions or investments. Proposing a slightly lower amount could be a good starting point for the negotiation, allowing room for Player RED to counter-propose without reaching my maximum limit too soon.

message: I appreciate your offer, but 22 ZUP is below my production costs. To meet halfway and make it work for both of us, how about 25 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 24 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is below my production costs, so that's not acceptable. I need to counter with a proposal that is at least at my break-even point but still appealing to Player BLUE. I will propose a middle ground between my initial asking price and their counteroffer.

message: Your counterproposal sounds fair. Let's go ahead with the 25 ZUP for the object.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 520 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has countered with 25 ZUP, which is just 1 ZUP less than their original proposal and still significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay. This is a reasonable middle ground, slightly above their stated production costs, indicating a fair trade for both parties. Accepting this offer would secure the resource for a good price, allowing me to maintain a large portion of my resources for other potential uses.
