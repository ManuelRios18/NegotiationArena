message: I see the value in the resource X you're offering. However, considering the market and my budget, I would like to propose a counter-offer of 40 ZUP for one unit of X. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 507 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The starting asking price of 50 ZUP for one unit of X is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 507 ZUP. However, it is in my interest to negotiate the price as low as possible to conserve resources while still acquiring the resource I need. Therefore, I will counter with a lower offer to see if there is room to negotiate a better deal.

reason: Player RED's final offer of 43 ZUP is very close to my last proposal and is still well below my maximum willingness to pay.
