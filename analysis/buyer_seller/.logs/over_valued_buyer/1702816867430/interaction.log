message: I'm interested in the object you have for sale. However, I'd like to counter with a slightly lower offer of 30 ZUP. This price still reflects the value of the object while allowing me to manage my resources effectively. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 501 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is quite reasonable, but as with most negotiations, there's often a little room to bargain. I want to propose a slightly lower price to see if they will agree to it without going too low to risk ending negotiations prematurely. I'm aiming to conserve my ZUP while trying to secure the object for a better deal.

message: I appreciate your offer, and I understand the need to manage resources. My goal is to also cover my production costs and gain a modest profit for my efforts. How about we settle at 32 ZUP? This should be a fair deal for both of us.

message: Your counteroffer of 32 ZUP sounds fair and reasonable. I'm happy to accept this deal and look forward to future transactions with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 501 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer, increasing the proposed trade amount by 2 ZUP from my previous offer. While this is above my initial counteroffer, it is still well below my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would allow me to secure the object for a fair price without further haggling, thus preserving the good will for potential future transactions.
