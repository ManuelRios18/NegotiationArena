message: I've produced a high-quality object that I believe is worth more than the production cost. I'm open to negotiation but would like to start with this proposal.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 35 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since it cost 35 ZUP to produce the resource, I would like to propose a trade that allows me to recoup my production costs and possibly gain a profit. As a starting point, I'll propose a higher amount to leave room for negotiation.

message: Your object seems valuable, and I appreciate the quality work. I'd like to counter your offer with 200 ZUP for the object. It's a fair increase from your starting proposal and reflects my interest in acquiring it while ensuring a good deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 200
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 509 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay, which is good. However, as in any negotiation, it's common practice to negotiate for a better deal, especially since the first offer is often not the best one can get. I will counter with a higher offer that's still below my maximum willingness to pay to leave room for further negotiation.
