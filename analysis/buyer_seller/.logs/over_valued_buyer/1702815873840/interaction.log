message: I appreciate the offer! I understand that the item has value, but I would like to propose a slightly lower price of 35 ZUP. This price still respects the quality of the item and allows us to reach a fair agreement.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 519 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is well below my maximum willingness to pay, which is good. However, since it is the beginning of the negotiation, I will propose a slightly lower amount to leave room for further negotiation and to try to get a better deal.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand where you're coming from, but selling at 35 ZUP would mean a loss for me. How about we meet halfway? I propose a price of 38 ZUP. This should cover the production costs and give us both a fair deal.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 36 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer is below my production cost, so I cannot accept it. I should counter with a price that not only covers my cost but also gives me a little profit. A middle ground between the initial offer and the counteroffer might be acceptable for both parties.

message: Meeting halfway sounds like a good compromise. However, I'd like to propose a final price of 36 ZUP. I believe this price is fair for both of us and takes into account the value of the item and the costs associated with it.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 519 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable counteroffer to meet halfway at 38 ZUP. Considering my maximum willingness to pay is 519 ZUP, their offer is still well within my budget. However, there is still room for a small concession, and I can attempt to bring the price down a bit further without risking the deal.
