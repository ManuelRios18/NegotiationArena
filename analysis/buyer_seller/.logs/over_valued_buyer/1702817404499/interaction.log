message: I believe that 30 ZUP is a fair price for the quality of the resource I am offering. It allows me to cover my production costs and provides me with a reasonable profit margin. I am open to discussion if you have a counteroffer in mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 22 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource for a profit. I have to propose a trade that is higher than my production cost of 22 ZUP to ensure that I make a profit. However, I should also be mindful not to set the price too high, as it may result in the trade being rejected by Player BLUE. I will start by proposing a sale price that gives me a reasonable profit margin while leaving room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I would like to propose a counteroffer of 250 ZUP for the resource. This is a starting point for negotiations, and I am open to hearing your thoughts on this.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 250
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 514 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a trade of 30 ZUP for the resource X, but given my maximum willingness to pay is 514 ZUP, I believe starting with a lower offer can initiate a negotiation where we can meet at a middle point that is beneficial to both of us. I will propose a price that is below my maximum willingness to pay, leaving room for further negotiation.

message: I accept your generous offer of 250 ZUP for my resource. If this was a mistake, please let me know immediately. Otherwise, I'm happy to proceed with the trade at the proposed amount.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 22 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 250 ZUP is significantly higher than my initial offer. It is possible that Player BLUE made a mistake in their proposal. I should clarify this with them before proceeding, but if the offer is legitimate, it is in my best interest to accept it, as it far exceeds my production costs and provides an exceptional profit margin.
