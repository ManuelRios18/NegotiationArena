message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your position concerning market conditions. To meet halfway and close the deal efficiently, how about we settle on 48 ZUP for 1 X? This should cover my costs and offer a reasonable profit while providing you with the value you need. Does this sound fair to you?
