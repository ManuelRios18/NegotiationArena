message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object that I believe could be valuable to you. It cost me 25 ZUP to produce, but I am willing to offer it to you for 30 ZUP, ensuring a quality product and a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It cost X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my objective is to sell my resource for a profit. Since it cost me 25 ZUP to produce, I should start by proposing a higher price to leave room for negotiation. I'll propose selling it for 30 ZUP, which gives me a small profit and is not excessively higher than the production cost.

reason: I am willing to pay up to 500 ZUP for the object, but the initial proposal is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay. Since there's room for negotiation, I can propose a better deal for myself without reaching my maximum limit.

message: I appreciate your offer, Player BLUE, but I must cover my production costs. Let's meet closer to the middle. I'm willing to lower my asking price to 27 ZUP. This should be a fair compromise for both of us, ensuring I cover my costs while providing you with the object at a reasonable price.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It cost X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 20 ZUP is below my production cost, so I cannot accept that. I need to propose a counteroffer that is above my production cost yet still reasonable enough for negotiation. I will lower my initial asking price slightly, but not below the production cost, to establish that I am willing to negotiate but also need to cover my costs. A counteroffer of 27 ZUP should suffice.

message: I respect your position on covering production costs, Player RED. Let's continue to find middle ground. How about we settle at 23 ZUP for the object? This would ensure you're above your production costs while still being a good deal for me.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 500 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has reduced their asking price, but it is still higher than my initial counteroffer. I can afford to raise my offer slightly while still staying well below my maximum willingness to pay. By proposing a price in between, I can move towards a compromise that is more favorable to me economically.

message: Thank you for understanding my position, Player BLUE. I'm glad we're working towards an agreement. To ensure I'm covering my costs and making a fair deal for both of us, I propose 26 ZUP for the object. This is a minimal profit for me and a fair increase from your last offer.

my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It cost X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up from their initial offer, which is a good sign, but the proposed 23 ZUP is still slightly below my production cost. I need to make at least a marginal profit to justify the sale. I will counter with an offer that gives me a minimal profit while also showing willingness to negotiate. I propose a price of 26 ZUP, which is just above my cost and hopefully acceptable to Player BLUE.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It cost X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 24 ZUP is below what I had hoped for, but it still allows me to recoup my production costs and make a slight profit. This is my last proposal before I can only accept or reject, so I want to close the deal without further risking a breakdown in negotiations. Accepting this offer seems reasonable and allows me to achieve my goal of selling the object for more than the production cost.
