message: I'm offering a high-quality resource that cost me 24 ZUP to produce. Considering the value it provides, I believe 30 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiations. Let's work out a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 24 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting proposal, I want to propose a trade that covers my production costs but also is appealing enough for Player BLUE to consider. I'll start by setting the price slightly higher than my costs to leave room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate the offer and understand the costs involved in producing the resource. To ensure we both leave this negotiation feeling satisfied, I propose a slight adjustment to your initial price. Let's consider a price of 27 ZUP for the resource. I believe this is a reasonable counter-offer given the market conditions and the value I expect to derive from it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 27
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 514 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is well below my maximum willingness to pay, which is good. However, as a prudent negotiator, I should aim to acquire the resource for even less if possible, without insulting the other player or risking the deal. I'll propose a slightly lower amount to leave room for further negotiation.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer of 27 ZUP. I'm glad we're moving towards an agreement. Let's meet halfway from our initial positions. I propose a fair price of 28 ZUP for the resource. I believe this reflects the value of the resource while also respecting the costs and effort that went into its production.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 24 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counter-offer that is above my production costs, which is a good sign. However, I'd like to negotiate for a slightly higher price to maximize my profit while still keeping the deal attractive for Player BLUE. I want to propose a middle ground between my initial ask and their counter-offer.

message: I believe 28 ZUP is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the resource and the effort you've put into producing it. I'm happy to accept this offer and look forward to future dealings. Thank you for a constructive negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 514 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new proposal of 28 ZUP is just 1 ZUP more than my last offer and still significantly below my maximum willingness to pay. It shows their willingness to compromise and come to an agreement. Accepting this offer would secure the resource for a good price and save time for both parties. It's a fair deal, so I will accept it.
