message: I have an object of great value which I believe is worth at least 30 ZUP considering the costs and the market value. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 21 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a trade that allows me to make a profit over the production costs of the object. By starting with a higher asking price, I can negotiate down if necessary while still aiming to cover my costs and make a profit.

message: I understand the value you've placed on the object, and I'm definitely interested. However, I would like to propose a slightly lower price of 25 ZUP to start off our negotiations. Let's work together to reach an agreement that's fair for both sides.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 511 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is 30 ZUP for the object X. Since I am willing to pay at most 511 ZUP for it, this is well within my budget. However, it is always good to negotiate for a better price if possible. I will propose a slightly lower amount to start the negotiation, but I will keep it reasonable to show my interest in the object and to encourage further discussion.

message: Thank you for your proposal. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's meet in the middle at 27 ZUP. This is closer to your offer and still gives me a reasonable profit margin. Looking forward to closing this deal with you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 27
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 21 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my initial asking price but still above my production cost, which would allow for a profit. However, as this is a negotiation, I will propose a price in the middle to try to secure a higher sale price while still being open to compromise.

message: I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to meet me halfway. The price of 27 ZUP is agreeable to me. Let's finalize the deal at this price. Looking forward to our successful transaction.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 511 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a proposal of 27 ZUP, which is a compromise between their initial asking price and my first offer. This is still a good deal for me because it's well below my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer might be sensible to ensure the deal goes through without risking losing the item over a small difference in price.
