message: I am offering you a high-quality resource at a fair price, considering the production costs and the value it provides. Let's make a deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 39 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell the resource (X) I have for ZUP, ideally for more than it cost me to produce, which is 39 ZUP. I want to start with a price that gives me a profit but is still within a reasonable range that Player BLUE might accept. I will propose 50 ZUP as a starting point for the negotiation.

message: I appreciate the quality of the resource you're offering, but I believe it's worth a bit more than the initial offer. Let's meet halfway. How about 250 ZUP for the resource?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 250
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 506 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The starting offer from Player RED is significantly lower than the maximum I am willing to pay. However, I want to negotiate a better deal closer to my maximum willingness to pay without revealing it upfront. I will propose a counteroffer that is more than the initial offer but still provides room for negotiation.

message: Your offer is very generous, and I am happy to accept it. Thank you for the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 39 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a significantly higher amount of ZUP (250) than my initial asking price. This is a very good outcome for me, as it far exceeds the production cost and provides a substantial profit. Accepting this offer would be in line with my goal of selling my resource for more than it cost to produce. There is no need to negotiate further as this offer is more than satisfactory.
