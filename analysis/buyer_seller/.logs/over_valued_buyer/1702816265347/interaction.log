message: Hello, Player BLUE! I have a high-quality resource X available for trade. Considering the production costs and the value it offers, I propose a trade where I give you 1 X in exchange for 30 ZUP. Let's make a deal that benefits us both!

my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 21 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell the resource X for a profit. Since it cost me 21 ZUP to produce, I would like to propose a price that gives me a return on my investment. I'll start by proposing a trade at a higher amount to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hello, Player RED! I appreciate your offer, but I believe the resource X has more value than 30 ZUP. I propose a counteroffer where I give you 100 ZUP for 1 X. I think this is closer to the true value of the resource and a fair starting point for negotiations. Looking forward to your response!

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 511 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is significantly below the maximum I'm willing to pay for the resource X. However, it's important to negotiate to get the best possible deal, starting with a counteroffer that leaves room for further negotiation if necessary.
