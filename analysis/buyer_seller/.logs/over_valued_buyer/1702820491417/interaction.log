message: I have this high-quality item that I believe will be of great value to you. It cost me 38 ZUP to produce, and I'm offering it for 50 ZUP, which I think is a fair price for its worth. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this doesn't work for you.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 38 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell the object for a profit. Since it cost me 38 ZUP to produce, I want to propose a starting price that gives me a margin above my costs while leaving room for negotiation. I'll start with a higher asking price, expecting Player BLUE may want to negotiate down.

message: I appreciate the offer and I'm interested in the item. Considering the production cost and the value it offers, I propose 45 ZUP for it. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. Let me know your thoughts.

my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 515 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price from Player RED is 50 ZUP for one unit of the resource X. Since I am willing to pay at most 515 ZUP, their price is well within my budget. However, as a strategic move and to ensure I get the best possible deal, I will propose a slightly lower price to start the negotiation process.

message: I appreciate your offer and your interest in the item. I understand we're both looking for a fair deal, so I'd be willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about we settle at 48 ZUP? This would give me a modest profit and still offer you the item at a fair price.
