message: I understand the value you've set on the object, but I believe a slightly lower price would be more in line with the market. How about 40 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 505 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is well below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I want to negotiate to see if I can get a better deal, perhaps closer to the market value. I have room to increase my offer, but I'll start with a conservative counteroffer to leave space for further negotiation.
