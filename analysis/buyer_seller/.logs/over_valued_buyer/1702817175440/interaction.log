message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. Considering the market and the value of the object, I'd like to counter with a proposal of 45 ZUP for your object X. This should cover your production costs and still offer you a profit. Let me know if this works for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 512 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP which is well below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as in any negotiation, there is an opportunity to counteroffer for a better deal. I will propose a lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate further.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your consideration of the market value. To meet halfway, I would like to propose 47 ZUP for my object X. This should give me a modest profit while still being a fair deal for both of us. I hope this counterproposal is acceptable to you.

my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP. While this covers my production costs and offers a profit, I would like to negotiate for a slightly higher amount to maximize my returns. I will propose 47 ZUP, which is a compromise between my initial ask and their counteroffer.
