message: I appreciate your offer and I understand that you're looking for a profit. While 30 ZUP is reasonable, I'd like to propose 28 ZUP for the resource. This would still give you a profit above your production costs and allow us to make a fair trade. What do you think?

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 512 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 30 ZUP, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 512 ZUP. However, it's always good to negotiate for a better deal, especially since the production cost is only 25 ZUP. Proposing a slightly lower price could still ensure that Player RED makes a profit, while also saving some of my resources.

message: Meeting in the middle at 29 ZUP sounds like a fair compromise to me. I accept this offer. Looking forward to our trade and possibly more in the future.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 512 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counter-offer to split the difference at 29 ZUP. This is only 1 ZUP more than my last offer and still well below my maximum willingness to pay. It seems like a fair compromise that ensures a quick agreement and maintains good relations for potential future transactions.
