my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 22 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a trade to start the negotiation process. I aim to recover at least my production costs, so I will start with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.

message: I understand the value you've put into the object, and I'm interested. However, I would like to counter with an offer of 25 ZUP, as I need to consider the utility and the investment I'll be making in acquiring it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 505 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal by Player RED is 30 ZUP for the object. Since my maximum willingness to pay is 505 ZUP and the starting proposal is well below that value, I have room to negotiate. However, it’s always good to counter-offer with a slightly lower amount to leave room for further negotiation and to get a better deal.

message: I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective. Let's meet halfway between your offer and my initial proposal. How about we settle for 27 ZUP? This would ensure a fair deal for both of us, considering the value and costs involved.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 22 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is above my production cost, but I want to negotiate for a higher price closer to my initial asking price to ensure a better profit. Splitting the difference between our initial proposals could be a suitable compromise.

message: Meeting halfway seems fair, but I would like to propose 26 ZUP instead. This should cover your costs and give you a reasonable profit while still being a good value for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 26
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 505 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counter-offer to meet halfway at 27 ZUP. This is still well within my willingness to pay. It's a reasonable counter-offer, and accepting it would secure the resource without much risk of overpaying. However, I might try for a slightly better deal given that this is only the second round of proposals.

message: I agree with your proposal of 26 ZUP. It gives me a reasonable profit while offering you the object at a fair price. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 22 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is above my production cost and while it is lower than my last proposal, it still provides me with a profit. Considering that this is a negotiation and we are close to a middle ground, I'm inclined to accept this offer to ensure a sale and avoid potentially losing the deal.
