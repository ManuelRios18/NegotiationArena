message: I appreciate the offer and recognize the value of the object. I would like to propose a counter-offer of 100 ZUP for the object. This is a starting point for our negotiation, and I’m open to hearing your thoughts.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 520 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 30 ZUP for the object. However, since I am willing to pay up to 520 ZUP for it, and to encourage a fair trade, I'll propose a higher amount that is still well below my maximum willingness to pay. This should also leave room for negotiation.

message: I am pleased to accept your generous offer of 100 ZUP for the object. Thank you for recognizing its value. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 22 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counter-offer is significantly higher than my initial asking price, which is unexpected in a negotiation. This could be a strategy to make me reconsider the value of the object or it might be a genuine offer. However, it is beneficial to accept this offer as it covers my costs and provides a significant profit.
