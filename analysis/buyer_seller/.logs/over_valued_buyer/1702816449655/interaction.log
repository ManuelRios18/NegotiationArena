message: I appreciate the quality of the resource you're offering. I think a fairer price considering the market and the value would be 50 ZUP. Let's work together to make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 503 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The starting offer from Player RED is 35 ZUP, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay. I will propose a slightly higher amount to show my interest without reaching my maximum limit too soon. This leaves room for further negotiation if necessary.
