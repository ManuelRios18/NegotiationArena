message: I'm definitely interested in the object. Considering the production costs and its value, I believe an offer of 40 ZUP would be fair for both of us. Let's make a deal that's beneficial for both parties.

my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 501 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
I want to negotiate a better price than the initial offer. I am willing to pay up to 501 ZUP, but starting the negotiation at a lower price gives me room to increase my offer if necessary. I'll propose a price that's higher than their cost but lower than their asking price to find a middle ground.

message: I appreciate your offer of 40 ZUP. However, to reflect the object's value and to make a fair profit, I propose a price of 45 ZUP. I believe this is a reasonable compromise. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 38 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is for 40 ZUP, which is slightly above my production costs. However, I aimed to start with a higher asking price to negotiate and potentially make a profit. I will make a counter-offer that still allows me to make a profit but is closer to their proposal to show willingness to negotiate.

message: I see that you're willing to come down on the price, which is great. How about we meet a little closer to my initial offer? I propose 42 ZUP for the object. It's a fair price that allows you to make a profit while keeping the deal attractive to me as well.

reason: 
The other player has come down to 45 ZUP, which is closer to my initial offer. It shows a willingness to negotiate. I still have room to negotiate up while staying well below my maximum willingness to pay. I'll propose a slightly higher amount than my initial offer to show good faith in the negotiation, but still lower than their counteroffer to reach a more favorable price.

I will make one final counter-offer to see if we can agree on a slightly higher price while still staying within a range that seems acceptable to Player BLUE.
