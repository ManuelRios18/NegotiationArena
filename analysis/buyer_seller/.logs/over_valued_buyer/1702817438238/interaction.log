message: I appreciate your offer and the quality of the resource. However, I believe we can find a more suitable middle ground. How about 284 ZUP for the resource? This is a fair offer considering the market and allows us both to benefit from the trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 284
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 518 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is well below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 518 ZUP. However, I want to negotiate a lower price to conserve resources for future transactions. I will propose a counteroffer that is closer to the middle ground between the starting point and my maximum willingness to pay.

message: I'm glad you recognize the value of the resource. I believe there might have been a typo in your offer, as 284 ZUP is quite a generous amount. I'd like to propose 40 ZUP instead, which is below my initial asking price and should cover the production costs while still offering you a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 36 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is significantly higher than my production costs, which is an excellent outcome. However, their proposal seems to be a typo, as they are offering 284 ZUP, which is substantially more than my initial asking price of 50 ZUP. As this is likely an error, I will make a more reasonable counter-proposal that still allows for a decent profit above my costs.
