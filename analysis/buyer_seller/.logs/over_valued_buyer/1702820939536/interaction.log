message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to offer you my object X for 30 ZUP. This is a quality product that I believe is worth the price. I'm open to hear your thoughts and negotiate further if needed.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 26 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since it cost me 26 ZUP to produce the resources, I would like to start with a proposal that gives me a profit. However, I must be cautious not to propose a price that is too high, which might lead to an immediate rejection by Player BLUE. I will propose a starting trade that is somewhat higher than my production costs to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand the value of the object, but I'd like to counter with 25 ZUP for the object X. I'm sure we can find a fair price that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 503 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer made by Player RED is well below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 503 ZUP. However, as in any negotiation, it's beneficial to counter with a lower offer to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both parties.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Player BLUE. However, it's below my production costs. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial proposal. How about 28 ZUP for the object X? I believe this price is fair for both of us, covering my costs and giving you the value you seek.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 26 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is below my production costs, so I cannot accept that. However, since this is a negotiation and they have shown willingness to find a middle ground, I will propose a price that covers my costs and provides a profit, but is lower than my initial proposal to move the negotiation forward.

message: I believe 28 ZUP for the object X is a fair compromise and I'm happy to accept this deal. Thank you for meeting me halfway, Player RED.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 503 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a compromise by reducing the price to 28 ZUP. This is closer to my initial counteroffer and still significantly below my maximum willingness to pay. It makes sense to accept this offer as it is a good deal for me and falls within my intended expenditure range.
