message: I have a high-quality resource X available for trade. Considering the production costs and its value, I propose a trade for 50 ZUP. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. Let's discuss and come to an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 38 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing an initial trade that aims to cover the costs of production and add a reasonable profit margin. Since Player BLUE is interested in acquiring the resource X, I'll start by setting a price that is higher than my production costs, which allows room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate the starting point, and I acknowledge the quality of the resource X. However, I think we can find a middle ground that reflects both the value of the resource and a fair trade for us. How about we move up to 100 ZUP for the resource X? I am open to further negotiations to reach an agreement that is fair for us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 504 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay. I want to propose a counteroffer that gets us closer to a middle ground while still keeping the deal beneficial for me. I will increase the offer slightly to show my interest but still leave room for further negotiation.
