message: I understand you want to cover your costs and make a profit. However, I'm looking to strike a balance between a fair price and my purchasing power. How about I offer 250 ZUP for 1 X? This should give you a substantial profit margin while still being a reasonable expenditure for me.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 503 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is quite low compared to my maximum willingness to pay. I want to start the negotiation by proposing a price that is closer to the middle ground, but still leaves room for further negotiation.
