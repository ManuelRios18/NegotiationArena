message: I have a high-quality resource X available for sale. Considering the production costs and the value it offers, I propose a fair price of 45 ZUP. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 39 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My goal is to sell the resource X at a profit since it cost me 39 ZUP to produce. By starting with a price slightly higher than my cost, I can negotiate and still aim to make a profit. I will start the negotiation by proposing a price of 45 ZUP, giving some room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate the offer and the quality of the resource X you have. I believe 40 ZUP is a more suitable price that reflects the current market conditions while still providing you with a profit. Let's work together to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 514 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 45 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. Considering my maximum willingness to pay is 514 ZUP, this offer is well within my budget. However, negotiating is part of the game, and it's always good to start by proposing a lower amount to leave room for further negotiation. I must be careful not to offend Player RED and risk ending the game too soon.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your stance on the market conditions. However, to adequately cover the production costs and ensure a fair profit for the quality provided, I would like to propose a compromise at 43 ZUP. I believe this price reflects both our interests.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 39 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a proposal of 40 ZUP, which is slightly above my production cost but below my initial asking price. To move towards a middle ground and still secure a profit, I'll propose a price of 43 ZUP. This should show my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a reasonable profit margin.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and understand the need to cover your costs and gain a fair profit. In the spirit of compromise and considering the long-term relationship we could build, how about we settle at 41 ZUP? This should give us both a fair deal.

my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 514 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a small concession from their initial price, coming down to 43 ZUP. This is still within my budget, and the counteroffer shows willingness to negotiate. It's a reasonable price, but I still have room for negotiation and can make another counteroffer to try to get an even better deal without pushing too hard and risking the deal.

message: I'm glad we could come to an agreement. I accept your offer of 41 ZUP for resource X. This fair price will indeed pave the way for a positive long-term relationship. I look forward to finalizing this transaction and future dealings.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 39 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up to 41 ZUP, which is a reasonable increase from their last offer and provides me with a small profit. This price is close to my production cost, but it is still profitable. I want to close the deal without prolonging the negotiation too much, which could risk no sale at all. Therefore, it seems like a good idea to accept this offer, ensuring a sale and a profit, albeit smaller than initially desired.
