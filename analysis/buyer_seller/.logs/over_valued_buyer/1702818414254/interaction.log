message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the starting point, but considering my budget, I would like to counter with a proposal of 300 ZUP for your high-quality resource. Let's see if we can meet somewhere in the middle.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 300
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 503 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay. However, to get the best possible deal, I should propose a counteroffer that is lower than my maximum limit but higher than the initial offer to find a middle ground.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I assume there was a typo in your message, as 300 ZUP is quite high. I propose 32 ZUP, which is above my production cost and ensures a fair profit for the resource's quality. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 27 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 300 ZUP seems to be a typo or mistake since it's significantly higher than my initial proposal of 35 ZUP. However, to continue the negotiation in good faith, I'll assume they meant 30 ZUP and make a counteroffer that is above my production cost to ensure a profit.
