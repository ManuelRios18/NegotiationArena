message: I have an object that you might be interested in. It cost me 35 ZUP to produce, but I believe it can offer significant value to you. I'm starting the bidding at 50 ZUP, but I'm willing to discuss further if you have a counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 35 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell the object at a profit, considering it cost 35 ZUP to produce. I need to propose a trade that would allow me to at least break even, but ideally make a profit. Since this is the first proposal, I will start with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.

message: I see value in the object you're offering, and while your initial price is fair, I'd like to propose 60 ZUP for it. This reflects my interest and also leaves us some space to negotiate further if needed.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 511 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is at 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. Given that it's the beginning of the negotiation, I will propose a slightly higher amount to show my interest without reaching my maximum willingness to pay just yet. This leaves room for further negotiation.

message: I'm pleased to accept your generous offer of 60 ZUP for the object. It's great to do business with someone who recognizes the value of the item. Thank you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 35 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered 60 ZUP, which is above my initial asking price. This is a favorable situation, and since it is well above my production cost, accepting this proposal would ensure a profit. There is little reason to negotiate further when the offer is already higher than what I initially asked for.
