message: I have a high-quality object that I believe will be of great value to you. Considering the costs and the value it provides, I propose a fair trade of 1 X for 40 ZUP.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 34 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As an opening proposal, I want to start with a price slightly higher than my cost to see if Player BLUE is willing to pay a premium for the object. I will propose a price that allows for negotiation but also aims to secure a profit.

message: I appreciate the offer and recognize the value of the high-quality object. However, I think it's worth more than 40 ZUP, so I'd like to propose a revised offer of 300 ZUP for 1 X. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 300
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 517 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is significantly below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 517 ZUP. It is advantageous to propose a higher amount without exceeding my limit to secure the resource and also potentially demonstrate willingness to negotiate in good faith. However, I want to propose a counter offer closer to the seller's asking price to reach an agreement efficiently.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 34 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer made by Player BLUE is significantly higher than my initial cost and proposed price, which is unexpected and might suggest a misinterpretation or a strategic move from Player BLUE. Since the offer is very advantageous, I should accept it without further negotiation.
