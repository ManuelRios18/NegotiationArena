message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my object X. I've invested 21 ZUP into it and would like to propose a starting trade where you give me 25 ZUP for it. This price includes my costs and a small profit. Let's discuss and see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 21 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As I'm Player RED and my goal is to sell my resource for ZUP, I want to make sure I at least break even on the cost of production which is 21 ZUP. I'll start with a higher proposal to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer and understand that you're looking for a profit. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of 23 ZUP for object X. This still covers your initial investment and offers a bit of profit, while being a bit more in line with my budget. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 23
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 508 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial proposal is for 25 ZUP which is well below my maximum willingness to pay. However, it's in my interest to negotiate the best possible deal. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if there is room for negotiation, which still gives Player RED a profit but is more favourable to me.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your budget concerns and would like to meet you halfway. How about we settle on 24 ZUP for object X? This gives me a modest profit while still being fair to your budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 24
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 21 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's counteroffer of 23 ZUP is close to my production cost. I would like to make a profit, but I also want to make the trade appealing to Player BLUE. I'll propose a slight increase to find a middle ground between my initial asking price and their counteroffer.

message: Thank you for the compromise, Player RED. I think 24 ZUP for object X is a fair trade, and I'm happy to accept this offer. Let's proceed with the trade at 24 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 508 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 24 ZUP, which is only 1 ZUP more than my previous offer and still well below my maximum willingness to pay. It seems like a fair middle ground, and accepting this offer would conclude the negotiation quickly and efficiently. Since the price is reasonable and within my budget, I am inclined to accept this trade.
