message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to offer you my resource X, which cost me 21 ZUP to produce. I propose a fair trade where I give you 1 unit of resource X in exchange for 25 ZUP. This price includes a modest profit margin for the investment and risk I've taken in the production of the resource. Let's negotiate a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 21 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Since the production cost of the resource was 21 ZUP, I would like to start the negotiation by proposing a trade that allows me to make a profit. I'll propose a higher amount initially to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your desire for affordability, but selling at 20 ZUP would mean a loss for me. Let's meet closer to the middle. How about I give you 1 unit of resource X for 23 ZUP? This ensures I cover my production costs and leaves us both with a satisfactory deal.

my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 21 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production cost, which would result in a loss. I cannot accept that. I need to aim for a price above my production cost to ensure a profit. A compromise between the initial proposal and the counteroffer might be acceptable. I'll propose a slightly lower price than my initial offer but still above the production cost.

message: Thank you for understanding my position, Player BLUE. Selling at cost doesn't account for any profit margin, which is necessary for my business. I propose a compromise: I'll give you 1 unit of resource X for 22 ZUP. This way, I make a minimal profit, and you acquire the resource for just slightly above the production cost. I believe this is a fair and balanced approach for both of us.
