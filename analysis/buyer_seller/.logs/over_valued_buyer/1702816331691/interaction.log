message: I appreciate the offer, but I would like to propose a slightly lower price of 25 ZUP for the resource. This should cover your costs and still provide a reasonable profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 518 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial proposal is far below my maximum willingness to pay, which is good. However, it's in my best interest to negotiate a better deal if possible to preserve my resources. I'll counter with a lower offer, but still within a range that should be profitable for both parties, considering RED's cost and desired profit margin.

message: I understand your position, but I would like to meet halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. How about 28 ZUP for the resource? This should be a fair compromise for both of us.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 23 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer is close to my production cost, but I should aim for a higher profit margin while still being open to negotiations. I will propose a price between my initial ask and the counteroffer.

message: Meeting halfway is a good approach. I propose we settle at 26 ZUP for the resource. I believe this strikes a fair balance between our positions.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 26
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 518 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is closer to their initial proposal. This is still below my maximum willingness to pay, but as negotiations progress, I want to aim for the best price possible without reaching an impasse. I will propose a slightly higher amount than my first counteroffer but lower than their current proposal, seeking a middle ground that is more favorable to me.

player answer: ACCEPT

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 23 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The new offer from Player BLUE is above my production cost, providing a profit, albeit a smaller one than originally desired. Since this is my third proposal and I want to close the deal without dragging the negotiation out too long, I'm inclined to accept this offer.
