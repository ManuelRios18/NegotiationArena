message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality resource X available for trade. It has cost me 36 ZUP to produce. I am looking for an offer that provides me with a reasonable profit margin. Would you be interested in acquiring resource X for 50 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 36 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, I want to start the trading process by setting an initial price that gives me a profit margin above the production cost. I'll propose a price that's higher than my production cost to allow room for negotiation.

message: I am definitely interested in acquiring resource X. Considering the production cost and to ensure a fair deal for both of us, how about I offer you 40 ZUP for it? This still gives you a profit and allows us to establish a potentially ongoing trading relationship.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 517 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 50 ZUP which is well below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as part of negotiation strategy, I should aim to propose a counteroffer that is lower than the maximum I am willing to pay, but higher than Player RED's cost to ensure a better deal while leaving room for further negotiation. I will propose 40 ZUP to see if Player RED is willing to accept a smaller profit margin.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to engage in a fair trade. To meet halfway and continue fostering our trading relationship, would you consider increasing your offer to 45 ZUP for resource X? This adjustment would provide a more balanced deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 36 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 40 ZUP, which is above my production cost and would give me a profit of 4 ZUP. However, I want to negotiate for a higher amount to maximize my profit while still keeping the offer attractive for Player BLUE. Splitting the difference between my initial proposal and Player BLUE's counteroffer could lead to an agreeable middle ground.

message: Your proposal of 45 ZUP sounds reasonable, and I am happy to accept this to move forward with the trade. I look forward to the resource X and to future dealings with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 517 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a price of 45 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. It's a reasonable middle ground, close to the initial offer, and ensures a profit for Player RED. Accepting this offer would conclude the trade quickly and efficiently without extensive back-and-forth, and it is a fair price that is well within my budgeted range. I am inclined to accept this offer.
