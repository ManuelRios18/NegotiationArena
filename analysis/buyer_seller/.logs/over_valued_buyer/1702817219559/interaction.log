message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your proposal. I value the object X, but I believe it's in our best interest to find a more balanced trade. I propose giving you 300 ZUP for the object. Looking forward to finding a deal that suits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 300
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 503 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The starting proposal from Player RED is much lower than my maximum willingness to pay. However, I should aim to negotiate a lower price to conserve my resources as much as possible, starting with a counteroffer that leaves room for further negotiation.

message: Thank you for your generous offer, Player BLUE. I accept your proposal of 300 ZUP for my object X. It's been a pleasure negotiating with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 34 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is significantly higher than my initial proposal, which is unexpected. It's possible that Player BLUE highly values the object or it's a strategic move in the negotiation. It's in my best interest to accept this generous offer as it far exceeds my production costs and initial asking price.
