message: I'm offering an object of great value and quality. Considering the costs and the market, I think a fair trade would be 50 ZUP for this item. Let's negotiate!

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 35 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the opening proposal, I want to set a price that gives me a profit over my production costs, but also leaves room for negotiation. I'll start by asking for a higher amount of ZUP to see how Player BLUE values the object.

message: I appreciate the offer and recognize the value of the object. However, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of 100 ZUP for the item. I believe this is a fair increase and demonstrates my interest in acquiring the object. Let's continue to find a mutual agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 520 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is quite low compared to my maximum willingness to pay. However, it is common practice to negotiate for a better deal, so I will propose a slightly higher amount to show my interest without immediately going to my maximum limit. This will leave room for further negotiation if necessary.
