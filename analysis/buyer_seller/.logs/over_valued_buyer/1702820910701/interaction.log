message: I appreciate the offer and understand the value of the object X. I propose a trade of 400 ZUP for the object, considering its high quality and my need for the resource. Looking forward to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 505 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP which is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 505 ZUP. However, it is in my interest to negotiate the best possible deal. I will propose a counteroffer that is closer to the middle ground but still below the maximum I am willing to pay.
