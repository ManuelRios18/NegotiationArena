my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my objective is to sell my resource (X) for ZUP. Considering the production cost of X was 25 ZUP, I would like to at least cover my costs. Therefore, my initial proposal will start above that amount to allow room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I'd like to counter-propose with 25 ZUP for the object X. It's a bit closer to the valuation I had in mind, considering the market conditions. Looking forward to finding common ground.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 511 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is lower than the maximum I'm willing to pay, which is a good starting point. However, it's essential to negotiate to try and get a better deal if possible. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if there is room for negotiation, but I'm careful not to propose too low so as not to offend Player RED or shut down the negotiation process.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking for a fair deal. How about we meet in the middle? I propose 27 ZUP for object X. This would allow me to cover the production cost and gain a slight return on my investment.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered exactly what it costed to produce the resource. While this would not result in a loss, it's also not profitable. I will counter with a slightly higher amount to aim for a small profit while still being reasonable to the buyer.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and understand your need to cover costs. Let's go with 26 ZUP for object X. This offer is just below our middle ground and should be a beneficial compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 26
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 511 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new proposal is still well below my maximum willingness to pay. Meeting in the middle is a common negotiation technique and the new offer is reasonable. However, considering I have room to negotiate and in the spirit of the negotiation process, I will make another counteroffer, slightly below Player RED's latest proposal, to maximize the value I can get for my ZUP.
