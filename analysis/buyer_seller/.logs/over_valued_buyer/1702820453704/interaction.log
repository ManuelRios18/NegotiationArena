player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 200
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 518 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The starting offer from Player RED is well below my maximum willingness to pay. However, it is advantageous to negotiate to achieve a lower price than my maximum willingness to pay. I will propose a price higher than the initial offer to show my interest but still lower than my maximum to leave room for further negotiation.
