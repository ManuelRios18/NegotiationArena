message: I am offering one unit of resource X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This is a fair deal considering the production cost and the quality of the resource.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource (X) for a profit. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I want to propose a trade that gives me a return above my costs. I will start by proposing a trade at a higher price to gauge Player BLUE's willingness to pay and leave room for negotiation.
