message: I'm offering the resource X, which cost me 25 ZUP to produce. I believe 30 ZUP is a fair price that reflects the value of the resource and includes a modest profit for the transaction. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm proposing an initial trade that covers my production costs and gives me a reasonable profit margin. Since ZUP is the currency Player BLUE uses to buy resources, I'll start by asking for an amount that is greater than my production cost to leave room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate the offer and understand the need for a profit. However, I believe that we can work out a better deal. How about I offer you 250 ZUP for the resource? This is well above your production cost and should provide you with a substantial profit while remaining within my budget.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 504 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I am proposing a counteroffer that is significantly below my maximum willingness to pay but higher than the cost of production for Player RED. This allows room for negotiation and aims to reach a deal that is beneficial for both parties.
