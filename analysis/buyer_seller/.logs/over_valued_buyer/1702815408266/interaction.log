my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 27 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resources for ZUP, and since it cost me 27 ZUP to produce, I would like to propose a starting trade that allows me to at least break even or make a small profit. It's the first proposal, so I will start slightly higher to give room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate the initial offer and understand the costs involved. However, I would like to propose a slightly lower amount of 25 ZUP to ensure a fair deal for both of us. Let's continue this negotiation in good faith.
player answer: PROPOSAL

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 513 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 30 ZUP, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay. It's a good starting point for negotiations, but it might be possible to get a better deal by proposing a slightly lower amount. I will counter with a proposal that still offers a profit for Player RED, given their cost of 27 ZUP, but also tries to save some of my resources.

message: Thank you for your offer. I understand the need for a fair deal. Considering the production costs, I propose a compromise at 28 ZUP. This would allow me to cover my costs and make a small profit, which I believe is reasonable for both parties.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 27 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production costs, so I would be losing money if I accepted it. However, since negotiation is part of the process, I'll make a counteroffer that is still above my costs but closer to their offer. This should indicate my willingness to negotiate while also maintaining my need for a profit.

message: I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. To meet halfway between our offers, I propose 26 ZUP. This should cover your costs and provide a fair profit margin while maintaining a good deal for both of us.

my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 513 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 28 ZUP, which is still a good price for me. It's closer to their initial asking price, showing they value their resource, but they're still willing to negotiate. There's room to accept this trade, but I could also propose 26 ZUP to meet in the middle of our two previous offers. This would still give Player RED a profit and save me some ZUP. I need to be mindful of the number of proposals I can make.
