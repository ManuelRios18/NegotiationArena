message: I appreciate the offer, but considering my budget, I would like to propose a counter-offer of 25 ZUP for the resource. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 512 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 30 ZUP, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a strategic move, I should counter with a lower offer to leave room for negotiation and potentially arrive at a more favorable trade for myself.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer. I understand we're trying to find a middle ground. My production costs were 27 ZUP, so I can't go as low as 25 ZUP. How about we settle at 28 ZUP? This would cover my costs and give me a minimal profit. What do you think?

my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 512 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 28 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. It is close to their stated production cost, and they are looking for a minimal profit. I could accept this proposal, as it's a reasonable price and within my budget, but I'll try to negotiate a slightly better deal for myself while being fair to Player RED.
