message: I appreciate the offer and understand the production costs. However, I would like to propose 35 ZUP for one unit of X, considering the market rates and the quantity I'm willing to purchase. Does this work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 520 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer by RED is for 40 ZUP, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 520 ZUP. However, as in any negotiation, it's beneficial to counter with a lower offer to try and reach a more favorable deal. I will propose a price that is closer to their production cost but still gives them a profit.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. Considering both the production costs and market rates, I propose a compromise at 38 ZUP for one unit of X. This should provide a fair middle ground for both of us. Would you consider this trade?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 32 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a lower offer than I initially proposed. While 35 ZUP still offers me a profit, I would like to counter with a slightly higher amount to better reflect the value of the resource and my production costs. A compromise between the two offers should be fair for both parties.

message: The price of 38 ZUP seems like a fair compromise. I am happy to accept this trade. Let's proceed with the transaction.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 520 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 38 ZUP is still below my maximum willingness to pay. It is closer to their initial asking price and suggests that RED is looking for a quick sale but is open to negotiation. I will agree to this price as it is fair, and it allows me to save my resources for potential future transactions while still securing the resource I need.
