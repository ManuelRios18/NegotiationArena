message: I've invested 21 ZUP into producing this resource. I believe 25 ZUP is a fair price considering the production costs and the quality of the resource. Let's negotiate a price that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 21 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource, X, for ZUP. Since it cost 21 ZUP to produce, I would ideally like to make a profit. However, I'm willing to start with a slightly higher asking price to leave room for negotiation. I will propose a starting trade that gives me a reasonable profit margin while also being open to counteroffers from Player BLUE.

message: I appreciate the craftsmanship and effort you've put into producing the resource. Considering the market rates and the value of ZUP, I'd like to propose 20 ZUP for the resource. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation. Let's work together to find a price that is agreeable to both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 512 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price from Player RED is 25 ZUP, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay (512 ZUP). However, as a player aiming to negotiate the best deal, I should propose a lower amount to start the negotiation process and potentially save resources. I'll start by offering slightly less than the asking price to open negotiations and see if Player RED is willing to accept a slightly lower price.

message: I understand your position and the need to find a fair price. My production costs are 21 ZUP, so selling at 20 ZUP would mean a loss for me. Let's meet in the middle—how about 23 ZUP for the resource? This would cover my costs and give me a modest profit, while still being a reasonable deal for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 23
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 21 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 20 ZUP is below my production cost, so I cannot accept it. I need to counter with a proposal that covers my costs and allows for a small profit, while still being within a range that might be acceptable to Player BLUE. A compromise between their offer and my initial proposal could be a good next step.

message: I believe your counteroffer of 23 ZUP strikes a good balance between your production costs and the value of the resource. I accept this price and am ready to proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 512 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has counteroffered with a price of 23 ZUP, which is above their stated production costs and still below my maximum willingness to pay. It seems like a fair compromise, as it allows RED to make a profit while I secure the resource at a reasonable price. Since their counteroffer is close to my initial offer and well within my budget, it might be in my best interest to accept this deal to ensure a successful transaction without dragging out the negotiation process.
