message: I appreciate the offer, Player RED. I believe we can reach an even more mutually beneficial agreement. How about I offer you 25 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X? This still provides you with a profit, and we can both walk away satisfied.
player answer: PROPOSAL

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 514 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's asking price is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay which is 514 ZUP. However, I'd like to propose a slightly better trade for myself to see if I can secure the resource for less than the initial asking price, while still keeping the deal attractive for Player RED.

message: I'm glad we're moving towards a deal, Player RED. I'd like to propose 27 ZUP for the 1 unit of resource X. This offer is very close to your last one and should help us finalize our trade with both of us feeling content with the outcome.
player answer: PROPOSAL

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 514 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on the price, but there still might be room for negotiation to get a better deal. Proposing a slightly lower amount than 28 ZUP could potentially save resources while still reaching an agreement that is fair for both parties. I will propose 27 ZUP, which is closer to Player RED's last offer and still well below my maximum willingness to pay.
