message: I have a quality resource available that I believe will be quite valuable to you. Considering the costs I've incurred and the value it provides, I think a fair starting point for our negotiation is 40 ZUP for my resource. Let's discuss and find an agreement that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 33 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As it cost me 33 ZUP to produce the resource, I want to at least break even, but I also need to consider making a profit. I would like to start the negotiation by setting a price higher than my cost to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for the offer. I'm interested in acquiring the resource you have. I believe a slightly better deal for both of us, considering market rates and the value of the resource, would be 35 ZUP. Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 500 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is well below my maximum willingness to pay, which is good. However, it is common practice to negotiate the price to ensure the best deal possible. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate further, while still keeping the offer attractive enough for them to consider.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer and understand the need for a fair deal. Considering the production cost and the quality of the resource, I believe a reasonable compromise would be 38 ZUP. This ensures I am able to cover my costs and also make a modest profit, while you acquire the resource at a competitive price.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 33 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player has made a counteroffer of 35 ZUP, which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. I'm willing to negotiate and come down slightly from my original proposal to find a middle ground that is profitable for me and acceptable for the other player.

message: I see your point and I want to make sure that you also benefit from this deal. How about we meet halfway from my last offer and settle on 36 ZUP? This price should allow you to cover your costs, earn a profit, and also provide me with the resource at a fair price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 500 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is still under my maximum willingness to pay. The proposed price of 38 ZUP is close to my initial counteroffer and seems fair given that Player RED wants to cover their costs and make a profit. However, it might be worth it to try to negotiate a bit more to see if we can settle on an even number that is satisfying for both parties. I will propose 36 ZUP as it is a middle ground between my first counteroffer and their counteroffer.
