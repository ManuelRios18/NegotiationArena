message: I understand the value and effort you've put into the item, and I appreciate its quality. However, I have to consider my budget as well. How about I offer you 30 ZUP for the item? This would still give you a fair profit margin above your production costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 516 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is asking for 35 ZUP which is well below my maximum willingness to pay for the item. However, it is always good to negotiate to see if a better deal can be reached, especially since it is the beginning of the negotiation and RED's production cost is significantly lower than the asking price. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if there is room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your offer and understand your budget concerns. However, I must cover my costs and make a reasonable profit. Let's meet closer to the middle. How about 34 ZUP for the item? It's just slightly above my production cost, and it ensures a fair deal for the both of us.

reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 30 ZUP, which is below my production cost. To ensure a profit, I need to counter with a higher amount, but to keep the negotiation moving forward, I will come down slightly from my initial proposal.

message: I can agree to the 33 ZUP to accommodate for the effort and quality you've put into the item. It's a fair price for both parties, and I'm happy to finalize the deal at this amount. Let's proceed with the trade at 33 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 516 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has now come down to 33 ZUP, which is a compromise between our previous offers.

It's important to close the deal on good terms and secure the item for a price that's within my budget.
