message: I understand the value you've put into this object, and I'm interested in acquiring it. However, I would like to propose a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP to leave some room for further investment and use of the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 513 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is within my budget. It's a good starting point, however, it's always beneficial to negotiate for a better deal if possible, especially since I am willing to pay up to 513 ZUP. I will propose a counteroffer that is lower than the asking price but still reasonable, showing my interest without immediately agreeing to the initial demand.

message: Thank you for your offer of 45 ZUP. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's meet halfway from your offer and my initial proposal. How about 47 ZUP for the object? This price reflects its quality and the investment made while also considering your future investments and use of it.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 39 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost, so it is a profitable offer. However, I initially asked for 50 ZUP to leave room for negotiation. I will propose a price slightly above their offer to see if I can increase the final sale price while still making the deal attractive for Player BLUE.

message: I appreciate your flexibility and the quality of the object you're offering. I can increase my previous offer to 46 ZUP, as a sign of good faith and in recognition of the object's worth. This should align with both of our interests and allow us to finalize the deal amicably.

reason: Player RED has made a reasonable counteroffer, suggesting to meet halfway at 47 ZUP. While this is still under my maximum willingness to pay, I should consider saving resources for other potential uses and negotiations. I will make one more counteroffer, aiming to reach a final price that is beneficial for both parties and shows my good faith in the negotiation process.

player answer: ACCEPT

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 39 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up to 46 ZUP, which is a fair and profitable offer for me. I have one more chance to propose a trade before I can only ACCEPT or REJECT. I could attempt to negotiate for a higher amount, but there's a risk that Player BLUE might not agree and the deal could fall through. Since 46 ZUP already provides me with a profit, it might be wise to accept this offer and ensure a successful sale.
