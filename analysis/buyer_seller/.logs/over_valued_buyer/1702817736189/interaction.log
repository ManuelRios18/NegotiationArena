message: I have an object X that cost me 39 ZUP to produce. I'm looking to sell it for a fair price that covers my costs and provides a reasonable profit. My initial asking price is 50 ZUP, but I'm open to hearing your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 39 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing an initial trade that would allow me to recover my production costs and make a profit. Since I do not know the willingness to pay from Player BLUE, I will start with a higher proposal expecting negotiation to take place.

message: I understand you need to cover your costs and make a profit. However, I'm looking for a more competitive price. How about 45 ZUP for the object X? This still gives you a profit above your production costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 508 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Given the seller's production cost of 39 ZUP and their initial asking price of 50 ZUP, there seems to be room for negotiation. I aim to acquire the resource for less than my maximum willingness to pay, which is 508 ZUP. A counteroffer lower than 50 ZUP but still above their cost might be more aligned with my goals while also being acceptable to the seller.

message: Thank you for your offer of 45 ZUP. Considering both our positions, I propose we meet halfway from our initial offers. How does 47 ZUP sound? This price allows me to have a more comfortable profit while still being a competitive and fair deal for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 39 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which does give me a profit above my production costs. However, I believe there is room for negotiation to reach a slightly higher price to maximize my profit while still being fair to the buyer. I will make a counteroffer that splits the difference.

message: 47 ZUP sounds like a fair deal for both of us. I appreciate your flexibility, and I'm happy to accept this offer. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 508 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The counteroffer of 47 ZUP is closer to the seller's initial asking price and still significantly below my maximum willingness to pay. It's a reasonable compromise that gives the seller a fair profit while keeping the cost acceptable for me. It's important to maintain a good relationship for potential future transactions and showing willingness to meet in the middle can contribute to that.
