message: I understand you're looking to make a profit on your investment of 36 ZUP. I'd like to propose 50 ZUP for the object X. This is above your cost, ensuring you make a profit, and it's a step towards finding a price that works for both of us. Let's continue to work towards a fair trade.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 515 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is asking for 40 ZUP for the object X. Since my maximum willingness to pay is 515 ZUP, there is a lot of room for negotiation. I will propose a counteroffer that is closer to my target price but still above the cost of production mentioned by Player RED to ensure that they make a profit. This will be my first proposal, leaving three more for further negotiation if needed.
