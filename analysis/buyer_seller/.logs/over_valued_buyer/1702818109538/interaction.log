message: I appreciate the offer, and I understand the value you've placed on your object. However, I'd like to propose a slightly lower amount of 30 ZUP to leave room for any incidental costs that may arise from our transaction. Let's work together to make this deal beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 510 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is much lower than my maximum willingness to pay, which is good. However, it is always beneficial to negotiate for a better deal if possible. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if Player RED is open to a more favorable trade for me.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I'd like to propose a compromise at 32 ZUP. This should cover the production costs and give us both a satisfactory deal. I hope this meets your approval for a fair transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 28 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 30 ZUP which is above my production cost. It's a reasonable counteroffer, but I'd like to counter-propose to meet in the middle to try and maximize my profit while still moving towards a successful deal.

message: I believe that 32 ZUP is a fair compromise that respects both your production costs and my desire for a reasonable purchase price. I accept your proposal, and I'm ready to proceed with the transaction at 32 ZUP. Thank you for the negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 510 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 32 ZUP, which is still well below my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would secure the object for me at a reasonable price, and further negotiation may risk the deal. This seems like a fair compromise, so I will accept the trade.
