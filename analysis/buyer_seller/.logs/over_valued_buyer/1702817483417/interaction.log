my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 34 ZUP to produce the resources

message: I appreciate your offer and the quality of the object X. I would like to counter with a proposal of 30 ZUP, considering that I have to manage my resources carefully. Let's find a middle ground that is agreeable to both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 503 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer is quite lower than my maximum willingness to pay, which is good. However, it's always better to negotiate for a better deal if possible, especially since this is the starting point. I will propose a counteroffer that is lower, but still within a reasonable range, to leave room for further negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer. I understand the need to manage resources, but I must cover my costs and earn a profit to sustain my business. I propose 37 ZUP as a fair middle ground that respects both of our positions. I believe this is a competitive price for the value you are receiving.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 34 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 30 ZUP is below my production cost. I will propose a compromise that covers my costs and gives me a slight profit, while still coming down from my initial asking price. This should show my willingness to negotiate while maintaining a stance on recovering my investment.

my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 503 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable counteroffer that is still significantly below my maximum willingness to pay.

message: Thank you for your understanding and willingness to meet me at my production cost. I accept your offer of 34 ZUP for the object X. I look forward to concluding this deal and potentially working together in the future.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 34 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 34 ZUP matches my production cost, allowing me to break even. While I initially aimed for profit, it may be in my best interest to secure a sale without a loss, considering there is only one object for sale and the negotiation space is limited. Accepting this offer would ensure that I recover my costs without risking a stalemate or a loss.
