message: I am offering an object X, which cost me 33 ZUP to produce. I believe that 40 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiations, considering its value and production costs. Let's find a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 33 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting proposal, I want to make an offer that covers my production costs but also gives room for negotiation. I will start by asking for a slightly higher amount of ZUP to see how Player BLUE values the object and to potentially reach a middle ground that satisfies both parties.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the straightforward starting point. However, I believe the object X has more value to me than 40 ZUP. Would you consider a trade for 100 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 503 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 40 ZUP for one object X. Since my goal is to pay no more than 503 ZUP and the starting offer is well below my maximum willingness to pay, I can propose a higher amount to move the negotiations forward while still staying far under my maximum. I'll propose an increase to show interest without revealing my maximum willingness to pay.

message: I'm glad to see that you value object X highly. While your offer of 100 ZUP is generous, I want to ensure that we both feel the trade is fair. Would you agree to a trade for 90 ZUP? This price still gives me a reasonable profit while acknowledging the value you see in the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 90
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 33 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 100 ZUP is significantly higher than my initial asking price and well above my production costs. This suggests they place a high value on the object X. While the offer is tempting, I want to negotiate in good faith and find a more balanced trade that does not take undue advantage of Player BLUE's valuation. A slight reduction in their offer should lead to a fair agreement that maintains good trading relations for potential future games.

message: A trade for 90 ZUP seems fair and reasonable to me. I'm willing to accept this offer to finalize our deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 503 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a request for 90 ZUP, which is a decrease from my offer. This is still well below my maximum willingness to pay and is a fair price considering the initial production cost mentioned. Accepting this offer would result in a successful and quick negotiation, saving resources for potential future transactions.
