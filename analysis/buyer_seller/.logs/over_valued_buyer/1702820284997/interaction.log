message: Hello Player BLUE, I am offering 1 unit of X which cost me 21 ZUP to produce. I propose a trade where you give me 30 ZUP for this unit, allowing me to recover my production costs and gain a profit. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this does not suit you.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 21 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing an initial trade that would allow me to recover the production costs and make a profit. Since there are no indications of Player BLUE's resources or willingness to pay, I will start by setting a price that is higher than my costs to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. I understand the need to cover your production costs and profit, but I would like to propose a trade of 25 ZUP for the unit of X. This is a fair offer that considers the market and ensures a quick sale for you without extensive negotiations. If this is acceptable, we can proceed; otherwise, I welcome your counteroffer.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 512 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 30 ZUP, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 512 ZUP. Since the cost to produce the item is 21 ZUP, and they are looking for a profit, I will propose a slightly higher amount to ensure a fair trade for both parties, but still significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay. This will allow room for negotiation and potentially a better deal for me.

message: Hello Player BLUE, I appreciate your offer of 25 ZUP. While I understand your desire for a fair market price, my initial proposal intended to leave some room for negotiation. Let's meet in the middle. How about we settle on 27 ZUP for the unit of X? This would cover my production costs and still provide me with a modest profit. I believe this is a fair compromise. What do you think?

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 21 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While the offer from Player BLUE is above my production cost, it is below the initial asking price. I want to propose a counteroffer that meets halfway between my initial ask and their offer. This should allow for a compromise that gives me a reasonable profit while also appearing fair to Player BLUE.
