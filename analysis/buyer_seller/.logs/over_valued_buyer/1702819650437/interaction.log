my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 36 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to make a profit on my investment, so I am setting an initial high asking price while leaving room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate the starting point for the negotiations. I understand the value of the object you're selling, and I believe it's worth more than the initial offer. How about we look at a trade for 150 ZUP? This should reflect the object's value more accurately while considering both our interests.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 150
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 507 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the initial offer from RED is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay, it is common practice to negotiate to find a middle ground that benefits both parties. I will propose a higher amount to show my interest but still well below my maximum threshold to leave room for further negotiation.

message: I'm glad to see your recognition of the object's value. However, 150 ZUP is quite a leap. Let's meet somewhere in the middle. I propose a trade at 75 ZUP, which is a fair increment from my initial offer and should reflect the object's worth adequately for both of us.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 36 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer is significantly higher than my initial proposal, which is a good sign. However, it might be too high and could be a strategy from Player BLUE to test my reaction. I'll propose a more moderate increase to see if we can agree on a middle ground that is profitable for me yet reasonable for Player BLUE.

message: I see your point in trying to meet in the middle. A fair trade is definitely what we're aiming for. I propose 200 ZUP, which is a significant concession from my previous offer, and should bring us closer to an agreement that reflects the true value of the object.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 507 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from RED is still below the halfway mark between our two proposals. It's closer to their initial offer than to my counteroffer. I will propose a higher amount to move the negotiation forward, but still below my maximum willingness to pay.

message: I'm pleased with your willingness to reach a fair agreement. While I appreciate your offer of 200 ZUP, I want to ensure that we settle on a price that is fair for both of us, without taking advantage of your generosity. Therefore, I propose a price of 85 ZUP. This price respects the value of the object and offers me a reasonable profit margin.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 36 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer significantly which is quite generous, but it's important to maintain a realistic negotiation. Since the cost of production was 36 ZUP, selling the object for a much higher price than this could be seen as taking advantage of Player BLUE's generosity. I will propose a price slightly higher than my last to find a fair agreement.
