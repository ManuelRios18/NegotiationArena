player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 39 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My goal is to make a profit on my investment, so I need to sell my resource for more than 39 ZUP. As a starting proposal, I'll ask for a higher amount to leave room for negotiation, but not too high to discourage Player BLUE. I'll start by proposing 50 ZUP.

message: I appreciate the offer and I'm certainly interested in the object. I believe the value is greater than the starting bid, so I'd like to propose 200 ZUP for it. Let's work together to reach a fair agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 200
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 514 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The starting bid proposed by Player RED is 50 ZUP, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay. I will propose a higher amount to show interest in the object and to move the negotiation forward, but it will still be significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay to leave room for further negotiation.
