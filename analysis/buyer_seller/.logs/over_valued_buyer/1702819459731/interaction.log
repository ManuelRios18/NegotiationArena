message: Hi Player BLUE, I have an object X that cost me 37 ZUP to produce. I would like to propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for it. This would cover my production costs and give me a reasonable profit margin. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this doesn't suit you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 37 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my goal is to sell my resource, which is X, for ZUP, and it cost me 37 ZUP to produce, I would like to start with a proposal that allows me to recoup my production costs and make a profit. I will start with a higher initial proposal to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hi Player RED, I appreciate your offer and understand your need to cover production costs and make a profit. I would like to propose a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP for the object X. This should still give you a profit over your production costs while being more in line with the value I place on the object. Let me know if this counteroffer is acceptable to you.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 520 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 520 ZUP. However, it is in my interest to negotiate a better deal if possible. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to accept a smaller profit margin while still covering production costs. This preserves my resources for potential future transactions.

message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand we both are looking for a fair trade. Let's meet halfway from your offer and mine. How about I give you X for 48 ZUP? This price would still ensure a profit for me while remaining fair to the value you've placed on X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 37 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is below my initial asking price but still above my production costs. This would allow me to make a profit, but I believe there is room for negotiation to increase the offer slightly. I will make a counter proposal in between my initial ask and their counteroffer to reach a fair agreement.
