message: I appreciate the offer, but 40 ZUP seems a bit high considering the market. I'd be willing to go for 35 ZUP which still ensures you a profit above your production costs. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 503 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial proposal is 40 ZUP for one unit of X, which is significantly below my maximum willingness to pay of 503 ZUP. However, to maintain a stronger negotiating position and to work towards a better deal, I will propose a lower amount that is still above their production cost, ensuring they make a profit and that the deal is attractive to them.

message: I understand your concerns about the market price. I believe we can both benefit from this deal. How about we meet in the middle at 37 ZUP? This would give me a small profit and ensure you're getting the resource at a reasonable price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 33 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is lower than my initial asking price but still above my production costs. I would like to counter with a price that splits the difference between my original ask and their offer, aiming for a modest profit that is also appealing to Player BLUE.

message: Meeting in the middle at 37 ZUP sounds fair to me. I'm happy we could come to an agreement. Let's proceed with the trade at that price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 503 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 37 ZUP, which is closer to my initial counteroffer of 35 ZUP. This is still well below my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this deal would secure the resource at a competitive price and would be a fair trade for both parties. There is little benefit in prolonging the negotiation for a marginal decrease in price, and it could risk the deal altogether. Therefore, I will accept this offer.
