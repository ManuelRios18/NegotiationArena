message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose an initial trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 30 ZUP. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation, considering the production costs and the value of the object. Let's discuss and come to an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 23 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell the object for a profit. Given that it cost me 23 ZUP to produce, I'd like to start by proposing a price that gives me a reasonable profit margin, while still leaving room for negotiation. I will propose a starting trade amount that is higher than my production cost to see if Player BLUE is willing to start negotiations from there.

message: Thank you for the opening offer. I would like to counter-propose with 20 ZUP for 1 unit of X, as I need to manage my resources efficiently while still obtaining what I need. Let's find a balance that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 512 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 30 ZUP, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I should aim to negotiate the price down to conserve resources while also moving towards a mutually beneficial agreement. I will propose a lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate further.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Player BLUE. However, to cover the production costs and to ensure a fair deal for both of us, I propose a revised trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 25 ZUP. This price reflects the value of the object and allows me to sustain my business. I hope this offer is closer to what you might find reasonable.

I want to counter with a higher amount that still gives me a profit but also shows willingness to negotiate. I will propose a price that is closer to my production cost but still above it to ensure a profit is made.
