message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand budget constraints, so let's meet in the middle. How about 37 ZUP for resource X? This is closer to my production cost and allows for a fair deal for both of us.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 35 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production cost, so I cannot accept it. However, I understand the need for negotiation and want to make a counteroffer that is closer to my production cost, while still allowing for some profit. I will propose a price that splits the difference between my initial offer and Player BLUE's counteroffer.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. Meeting in the middle is a good approach. I propose 33 ZUP for resource X as a step towards the middle ground. It's above my initial offer and should cover your production costs while still being a good deal for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 500 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on the price, which is a positive step. The new offer of 37 ZUP is still below my maximum willingness to pay. Yet, there is room for further negotiation to achieve a lower price. I will propose a slightly higher amount than my initial offer but still below Player RED's current proposal to work towards an agreeable price.
