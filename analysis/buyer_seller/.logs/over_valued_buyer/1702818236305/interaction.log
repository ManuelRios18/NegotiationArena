message: Hello Player BLUE, I am offering you my resource X, which cost me 28 ZUP to produce. I believe it will be of great value to you. I propose a trade of 35 ZUP for my resource. Let's negotiate a fair price.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 28 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource X for ZUP. I need to recover at least my production cost of 28 ZUP, but since this is a negotiation, I will start by proposing a higher amount to leave room for bargaining.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I understand the value of the resource you're offering, but I would like to propose a slightly lower price of 30 ZUP. I believe this is still a fair price that exceeds your production costs and provides you with a profit. Let's work together to come to an agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 515 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is reasonable, considering they're asking for 35 ZUP for the resource which cost them 28 ZUP to produce. I am willing to pay up to 515 ZUP for the resource, so their asking price is well within my budget. However, it's standard practice to negotiate, so I will propose a slightly lower price to see if Player RED is willing to accept it. This leaves room for further negotiation within my budget limit.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Player BLUE. To meet in the middle, I propose a price of 33 ZUP for my resource X. This price gives me a reasonable profit while still offering you the resource below my initial asking price. I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us.

my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 28 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counteroffer of 30 ZUP, which is above my production cost and provides me with a profit. However, as part of the negotiation process, I will counter with a price that's between their offer and my initial proposal, aiming for a higher profit while still making the deal attractive for Player BLUE.

message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. I accept your offer of 33 ZUP for the resource X. I believe this is a fair price for both parties, and I look forward to finalizing our trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 515 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 33 ZUP, which is closer to their initial asking price but still below it. The price is well within my budget, and it would be advantageous for me to accept this offer since it's significantly below my maximum willingness to pay. Therefore, I will accept this offer to ensure a successful trade without further negotiations, which could risk the trade if Player RED perceives me as too resistant to their terms.
