my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 32 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since it cost me 32 ZUP to produce the resource, I would like to start by proposing a trade that allows me to recover my costs with a small profit. Therefore, I will suggest a price slightly above my costs.

message: I understand the production costs and I appreciate the fair starting point. However, I'd like to propose 30 ZUP for the resource, taking into account that we might continue doing business in the future which could be beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 512 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's starting asking price of 35 ZUP for the single resource is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay. However, it's in my best interest to negotiate a better deal to conserve resources for potential future transactions or other uses. I will propose a price closer to the production cost mentioned to see if Player RED is open to a more favorable trade.

message: I appreciate your long-term business perspective and I'm willing to consider it. However, I can't go below my production costs. How about we meet a bit closer to my initial asking price? I propose 34 ZUP which covers my costs and offers me a slight profit margin.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 32 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production costs, which is not ideal for me. However, considering the potential for future business, I am willing to come down a little but not below my costs. I will propose a price that covers my production costs and gives me a minimal profit to keep the negotiation going.

message: I can see that you're looking for a slight profit, and I want to respect that. So let's settle on a price that covers your costs and gives you a profit, but is also closer to my initial counteroffer. How about we agree on 32 ZUP for the resource? This shows our mutual intention to work together with fair terms.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 512 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is not willing to go below production cost, which is understandable. However, they only reduced their asking price by 1 ZUP, which does not show much movement from the initial proposal. I want to make a counteroffer that is above the production cost but still saves me some ZUP. This can show my commitment to a fair negotiation while also looking out for my resources.
