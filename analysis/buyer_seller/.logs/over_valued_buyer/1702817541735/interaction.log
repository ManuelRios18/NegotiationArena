message: I'm offering one unit of X, which cost me 22 ZUP to produce. Considering the quality and value of X, I believe 25 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 22 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource for ZUPs, aiming to at least cover my production costs of 22 ZUP. My initial proposal should be higher than 22 ZUP to allow room for negotiation and to potentially make a profit.

message: I appreciate your offer, and I understand the costs involved in producing X. However, I'd like to propose a trade that better reflects the current market value that I've observed. How about an even trade where I give you 22 ZUP, which covers your production costs and ensures you are not at a loss?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 22
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 501 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is 25 ZUP which is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 501 ZUP. However, it is in my best interest to negotiate a lower price if possible to conserve resources for other potential uses or opportunities. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to consider it, but keeping the offer attractive enough to maintain the negotiation process.

message: I appreciate your consideration of my production costs. However, I need to account for the effort and time invested in producing X. Would you consider a small increase to 23 ZUP? This ensures I'm fairly compensated while still offering you a reasonable price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 23
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 22 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE covers my production costs, but it doesn't leave any room for profit. It's important to at least attempt to negotiate for a higher amount to see if Player BLUE is willing to pay a bit more, while also being careful not to push too hard and risk losing the deal altogether. A slight increase should be acceptable.

message: I see your point and agree that your time and effort should be valued. Let's go ahead with the 23 ZUP for one unit of X. I believe this is a fair trade for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 501 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a slight increase to 23 ZUP, which is still within a range that's very acceptable to me and below my maximum willingness to pay. By accepting this price, I can secure the resources quickly without extended negotiations and still have a significant amount of ZUP left for other transactions. Considering the counteroffer is reasonable and only 1 ZUP above my initial proposal, it seems like a fair deal.
