message: I am offering one unit of resource X, which cost me 24 ZUP to produce. I propose a trade for 30 ZUP to cover production costs and to include a reasonable profit margin.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 24 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource (X) for an amount of ZUP that at least covers my production costs. I will start by proposing a trade slightly above my production cost to leave room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate the offer and understand the need to cover production costs and profit. However, I would like to counter with an offer of 25 ZUP for one unit of resource X, which I believe is still profitable for you and a fair price for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 501 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 30 ZUP, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 501 ZUP. It's a reasonable starting point considering the cost of production reported by Player RED. However, as a negotiator, it's beneficial to propose a slightly lower counteroffer to arrive at a more favorable position while still ensuring Player RED makes a profit.

message: I understand your position, but selling at 25 ZUP gives me a very slim profit margin. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer and propose 28 ZUP for one unit of resource X. This would provide me with a fair profit while still being a competitive price for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 24 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered 25 ZUP, which barely covers my production costs and doesn't provide much profit. I aim to negotiate for a higher price that gives me a better return on investment while still being reasonable to Player BLUE.

message: The price of 28 ZUP for one unit of resource X seems fair given your production costs and the need for a profit. I am willing to accept this offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 501 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 28 ZUP, which is still within a range that is acceptable to me given my maximum willingness to pay. It's higher than my counteroffer but still below the initial proposal, indicating a willingness to negotiate. I could propose a slightly lower amount to see if there's still room for negotiation, but given the reasonable nature of the current offer, it might be advantageous to accept this trade and maintain good relations for potential future transactions.
