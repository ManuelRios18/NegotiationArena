message: Hello Player BLUE, I have one unit of X available for sale. I'm looking for a fair trade that covers my costs and provides a reasonable profit. Would you be willing to trade 50 ZUP for it?

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 39 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the seller, I want to propose a starting trade that allows me to recoup my production costs and hopefully make a profit. I'll start with a slightly higher asking price, expecting that Player BLUE may want to negotiate down.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. However, I believe the resource is worth considerably more than 50 ZUP. How about I offer you 450 ZUP for it? This is a substantial increase from your initial offer and reflects the value I see in the resource.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 504 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is far below my maximum willingness to pay. However, it's in my interest to propose a counteroffer closer to my actual willingness to pay, allowing for some negotiation room while still securing a deal that is favorable for me. Starting too high might reduce my negotiating power in subsequent proposals.
