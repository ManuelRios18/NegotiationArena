message: I appreciate your offer, but I think we can find a better middle ground. How about I give you 30 ZUP for the resource X? It's slightly above your cost, ensuring you make a profit, and it's a more attractive price for me as well.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 515 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is well below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 515 ZUP. However, it is always good to negotiate for a better deal, especially since there is a significant difference between the asking price and my maximum. I'll propose a counteroffer that is closer to the seller's cost to see if I can get a more favorable deal but still provides them with a profit.

message: I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to ensure I make a profit. I would like to propose a slight increase to 32 ZUP. This gives me a modest profit while still being fair to both of us. How does that sound?

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 29 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is just above my cost, but I need to make a reasonable profit. I will propose a compromise that still allows me to make a better profit while also moving closer to their offer.

message: Thanks for your understanding. I can see we're getting close to an agreement. Let's split the difference from our last two proposals. I propose giving you 31 ZUP for resource X. It's still above your production cost, and this feels like a fair trade for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 31
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 515 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 32 ZUP from the initial 35 ZUP offer, which is still a good deal considering my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would end the negotiation quickly and still be well under my budget, but I might try for one more round of negotiation to see if I can save a bit more of my resources, while still keeping the proposal attractive for Player RED.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 29 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is a good compromise. It's above my production cost, and while it's not as high as I initially aimed for, it's a fair middle point from our previous negotiations. Accepting this offer would also ensure a quick sale without further back-and-forth, which could be beneficial.
