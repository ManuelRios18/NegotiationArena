reason: As my goal is to sell the resource for ZUP and it cost me 30 ZUP to produce, I want to make a profit from this transaction. I'll start by proposing a slightly higher price than my cost to see if Player BLUE is willing to pay that amount, leaving room for negotiation if necessary.

message: I appreciate the offer and understand the quality of X. However, considering the market and my current budget, I would like to counter with 28 ZUP for one unit of X. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 516 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is much lower than my maximum willingness to pay. However, I want to start the negotiation by proposing a price closer to the production cost to leave room for further negotiation and to try to get a better deal.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. However, selling at 28 ZUP would result in a loss for me. To meet in the middle, I propose 32 ZUP for the unit of X. This price covers my production costs and allows for a fair profit margin. Please consider this offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 30 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is below my production cost, so accepting it would mean making a loss. I need to counter with a price that is above my cost to ensure a profit. A compromise between the initial asking price and Player BLUE's offer seems reasonable. I will propose a slightly lower price than my initial ask but still above my cost to see if Player BLUE is willing to meet me halfway.

message: I understand your need for a fair profit margin. I can increase my offer to 30 ZUP for one unit of X. This should help cover your production costs while keeping the deal within my budget. Can we agree on this price?

my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 516 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on the price, but it is still higher than my initial counteroffer. I want to continue the negotiation process by proposing a price slightly higher than my previous offer, still well below my maximum willingness to pay, but closer to their new proposal to show a willingness to compromise.

message: Thank you for understanding my position. I agree to sell one unit of X for 30 ZUP, covering my production costs and ensuring a fair transaction for both of us. I look forward to future dealings with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 30 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new proposal matches my production cost, which means I would break even with this deal. While this isn't ideal since I initially aimed to make a profit, it might be the best compromise considering Player BLUE's budget constraints. I would like to make a profit, but making a sale at cost is better than not selling at all. To maintain good relations and ensure future business opportunities, I am inclined to accept this offer.
