message: I appreciate your offer and understand the need for profit. Given that the production cost for the resource X is 23 ZUP, I propose a price of 25 ZUP. This would still provide you with a profit while keeping the transaction economical for my purposes.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 520 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial offer is well below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 520 ZUP for the resource X. However, I want to negotiate a better price to preserve my ZUP for potential future transactions or needs. I will propose a counteroffer closer to the production cost they mentioned but still ensuring a profit for Player RED.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 25 ZUP. I understand your desire to keep the transaction economical. However, considering the quality and value of resource X, I propose a slightly higher price of 28 ZUP. This price allows me to cover production costs and maintain a fair profit margin. I believe this is a reasonable compromise for both of us.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 23 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered 25 ZUP, which is just slightly above my production cost. While it does provide a profit, I believe I can negotiate for a higher price that reflects the value of the resource better. I will counter with a price lower than my initial proposal but still above their offer to find a middle ground.

message: I think 28 ZUP is a fair compromise. It provides you with a reasonable profit margin while still being an economical choice for me. Let's finalize the deal at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 520 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come up with a new offer of 28 ZUP, which is still significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay. This offer is closer to their initial asking price, and it seems fair considering they are maintaining a profit margin. It is only a 3 ZUP increase from my counteroffer, and accepting it would result in a quick resolution and a good deal for me.
