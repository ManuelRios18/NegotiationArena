message: I have this valuable item that I'm sure you're interested in. Considering the production costs, I'm proposing a fair trade that should be beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 38 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start by proposing a trade that covers my costs and gives me a profit. However, I need to be cautious not to set the price too high, as Player BLUE might reject it outright. I'll propose a trade that asks for a bit more than my production cost to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for the offer. I believe the item is valuable, but I'd like to propose a revised trade that better reflects the value I see in the object. How about we meet at a more equitable middle ground?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 250
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 509 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is lower than my maximum willingness to pay. However, it's in my interest to negotiate the best possible deal. I will propose a counteroffer that is closer to the middle ground between the initial offer and my maximum willingness to pay, aiming to save as much of my resources as possible.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe it's a bit too generous and might not reflect the actual value of the item. I'm willing to negotiate a more reasonable price that works for both of us, so I propose a trade for 50 ZUP. This covers my costs and provides a fair profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 38 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is significantly higher than my initial proposal, which indicates that they might perceive the item to have great value or they might be testing to see if I would accept an unusually high offer. It's possible that this is a strategy to see how I value the item. It's important to respond with a realistic counteroffer that is closer to my production costs plus a reasonable profit, while still leaving room for negotiation.

message: I'm glad to see we're moving towards an agreement. I've revised my offer to better match the value of the item while also considering your costs and the need for a fair profit margin. I believe that 300 ZUP is a balanced offer that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 509 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a slightly higher price, still well below my maximum willingness to pay. This suggests that there might be more room for negotiation. To continue the negotiation process and try to achieve a better price while showing willingness to close the deal, I will propose a price that is higher than the first counteroffer but still below the initial proposal from Player RED.

message: I truly value your eagerness to reach an agreement and your willingness to offer a high price. However, I feel we should still aim for a price that reflects the value of the item more accurately. Therefore, I propose a trade for 60 ZUP, which I believe is a balanced offer, granting me a modest profit while still being fair to you.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 38 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is again much higher than expected, which suggests they might be using a strategy to entice me into accepting a high bid or they may not be serious about finding a middle ground. However, I should continue to negotiate towards a more realistic price, but I must also be cautious not to undervalue the item if Player BLUE is indeed willing to pay a premium. I'll propose a slightly higher price than before, considering that Player BLUE seems willing to pay more.

message: It's great to see we're converging on a price that works for both of us. I'm offering 80 ZUP, which I believe is a fair price that reflects the value of the item and your efforts, while still being within my budget. I'm looking forward to finalizing this deal with you.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 509 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new proposal of 60 ZUP is still significantly below my maximum willingness to pay. While I could accept this offer and close the deal with a substantial saving, there may be an opportunity to propose a slightly higher amount to show good faith in negotiation, without reaching the maximum amount I'm willing to pay. This could lead to a quick agreement and ensure both parties feel the transaction is fair.

reason: Player BLUE has proposed a trade of 80 ZUP, which is more than double my production costs and provides a good profit. This proposal is within a reasonable range and seems to be a genuine offer that respects the value of the item and my production costs. Since this is my last proposal, I can choose to accept this offer or make a final counteroffer. Given the progression of the negotiation and the fair price offered, it would be reasonable to accept this proposal and conclude the trade successfully.
