message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand that you're looking for a profit margin above your cost. I propose to buy your resource X for 35 ZUP, which allows you a profit but is also closer to your production cost. Looking forward to your counteroffer if needed.

my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 506 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer is below my maximum willingness to pay, however, it is still advantageous to negotiate for a better deal. The seller's cost is 30 ZUP, so there is room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to meet near my production cost. To find a fair middle ground, I propose a revised trade where you give me 38 ZUP for my resource X. This price allows me a reasonable profit while still being an attractive purchase for you. Please let me know your thoughts on this.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 30 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 35 ZUP, which is above my production cost and would provide me with a profit. However, I believe there is still room to negotiate a slightly higher price while maintaining a fair deal for both parties. My next proposal will aim for a middle ground between my initial ask and their counteroffer.
