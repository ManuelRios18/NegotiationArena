message: I have an object that cost me 30 ZUP to produce. I would like to offer it to you for 50 ZUP, allowing me to make a profit and you to acquire a valuable resource. Let's negotiate a fair trade.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 30 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the first proposal, I will start by proposing a trade that allows me to make a profit on the item I have produced. I would like to start with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation, expecting that Player BLUE will likely want to negotiate for a lower price.

message: I understand your need for profit, and I believe in fair trade. However, I would like to make a counteroffer of 40 ZUP for the object. This is above your production costs, ensuring you make a profit, while also being reasonable for me to pay. Let's work together to find an agreeable price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 506 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has proposed a price of 50 ZUP, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay. However, it is in my interest to negotiate for a better deal, potentially closer to the seller's cost to increase the value of the transaction for me. I will propose a counteroffer that is higher than the seller's cost but still provides me with a good deal.

message: I appreciate your offer and your understanding of a fair trade. I'm glad to see that we're close to an agreement. Would you consider meeting halfway between our initial proposals? My counteroffer is 45 ZUP for the object. This price ensures a reasonable profit for me and a fair purchase price for you.

message: Thank you for the counteroffer. I believe that 45 ZUP is a fair price for both of us, and I am happy to accept this deal. Let's finalize the trade at that price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 506 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 45 ZUP is still a good deal for me, as it is well below my maximum willingness to pay. By accepting this offer, I would secure the resource for less than 10% of my maximum price, which is a favorable outcome. Negotiating further may risk the deal or yield minimal additional savings, which may not be worth the potential loss of the resource.
