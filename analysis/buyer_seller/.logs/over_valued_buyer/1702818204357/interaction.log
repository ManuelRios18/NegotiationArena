message: I am offering one unit of resource X, which cost me 26 ZUP to produce. I believe a fair starting point for this trade would be 30 ZUP. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits us both.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 26 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource for more than it cost to produce it, which is 26 ZUP.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 503 ZUP for the resources.
