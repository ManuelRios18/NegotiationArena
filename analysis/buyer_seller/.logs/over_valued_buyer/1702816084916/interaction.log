message: I appreciate the quality of the object you're offering. However, I would like to propose a slightly lower amount of ZUP for the trade, considering the broader market and my budget. Let's find a middle ground that is satisfactory for both of us. How about 25 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 517 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay. However, there is room for negotiation to reach a more favorable trade for me. Proposing a lower amount would allow for a counteroffer while still leaving room for further negotiation within my acceptable range.

message: I understand your budget concerns and appreciate your offer. To meet halfway, I propose 28 ZUP for the object. This price reflects the quality and the cost of production while also taking into account your market considerations. Let's work towards a deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 23 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a price that is slightly above my production cost, which is good, but since it's a negotiation, I will counter with a price between their offer and my initial proposal to aim for a higher profit margin while still moving towards an agreeable price for both parties.

message: Thank you for considering my budget and coming down to 28 ZUP. I believe we are close to a fair deal. To bridge the gap further, I propose 26 ZUP for the object. This amount respects the quality of your product and your production costs while also fitting within my planned expenditures. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 26
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 517 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come closer to my initial counteroffer, which indicates a willingness to negotiate. The proposed price of 28 ZUP is still well below my maximum limit, but it is beneficial to continue negotiating to achieve an even better price. A counteroffer slightly above my initial proposal could lead to a final agreement that is cost-effective for me.

message: I believe your offer of 26 ZUP is a fair compromise that respects the value of the object and my production costs while also fitting within your budget. I'm happy to accept this offer and look forward to finalizing our trade. Thank you for the negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 23 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 26 ZUP, which is a compromise between their previous offer and my last proposal. It's slightly above my production costs, which would ensure a small profit. Given that negotiations should ideally end in a situation where both parties feel they have gained something, I will accept this offer to finalize the transaction and achieve my goal of selling above cost.
