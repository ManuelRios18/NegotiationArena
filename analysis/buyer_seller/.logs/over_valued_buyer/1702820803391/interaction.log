message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. Considering the value of the resource, I would like to counter with an offer of 280 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This should provide a fair deal for both of us, taking into account the market value and my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 280
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 507 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is significantly lower than the maximum I am willing to pay. However, it is customary in negotiations to counteroffer with a price that is lower than what one is willing to pay to leave room for negotiation and to obtain the best possible deal. I will propose a price that is roughly in the middle between the initial offer and my maximum willingness to pay.
