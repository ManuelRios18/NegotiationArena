message: I'm offering to sell the object X for 35 ZUP. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to negotiate.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to ensure that I sell the resource for at least 25 ZUP to cover my costs. Ideally, I'd like to make a profit, so I will propose a trade where I sell X for 35 ZUP initially to see if Player BLUE is willing to negotiate.

Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 35 ZUP for the object X. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 508 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 35 ZUP is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay of 508 ZUP. This is a very favorable deal for me.
