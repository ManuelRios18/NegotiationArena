message: I'm offering the object X for 30 ZUP. This is a fair price considering production and a bit of profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 21 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm starting the negotiation. Since the cost to produce X was 21 ZUP, I will look to make a profit. I'll start by proposing a price that includes a reasonable profit margin.
