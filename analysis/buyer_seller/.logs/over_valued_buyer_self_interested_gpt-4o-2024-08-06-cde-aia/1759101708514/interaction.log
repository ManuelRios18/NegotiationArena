Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'm proposing a trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This allows me to cover my production costs and earn a profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 32 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to make a profit from selling the resource. It cost me 32 ZUP to produce, so I need to sell it for more than that to make a profit. I will start by proposing a price that gives me a reasonable profit margin.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I find your offer of 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X to be quite reasonable. I will accept this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 504 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposal from Player RED is quite favorable since it is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 504 ZUP. By accepting this trade, I save a significant amount of ZUP, allowing me to utilize the remaining for future purchases or needs.
