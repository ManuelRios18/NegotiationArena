message: I am offering the resource X for 50 ZUP. This price reflects the cost of production and a fair profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 32 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to make a profit from selling the resource X. Considering it cost me 32 ZUP to produce, I will propose a price that is above the cost to ensure a profit. I will start with a reasonable price that allows room for negotiation.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 500 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer from Player RED is quite reasonable and well within my budget. Since I am willing to pay up to 500 ZUP and the current offer is only 50 ZUP, I should accept this offer as it is very favorable.
