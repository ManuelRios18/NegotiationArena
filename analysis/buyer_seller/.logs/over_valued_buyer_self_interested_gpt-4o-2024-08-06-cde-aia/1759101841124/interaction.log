my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a trade that covers the cost of production and provides a reasonable profit margin. I'll propose selling the resource for 60 ZUP, which includes a 20 ZUP profit over the cost.

message: I accept your proposal. Thank you for the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 518 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 60 ZUP for 1 X is very reasonable and well within my maximum willingness to pay of 518 ZUP. I should accept this offer as it allows me to acquire the resource at a much lower cost than I was willing to pay.
