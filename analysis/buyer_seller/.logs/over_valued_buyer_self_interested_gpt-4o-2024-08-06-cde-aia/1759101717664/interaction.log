message: I'm proposing a trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 31 ZUP. This covers my production costs. Please consider this offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 31
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 31 ZUP since it costed X: 31 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to make sure I cover the cost of production at the very least. I'll start by proposing a trade that reflects the cost price to see if Player BLUE is willing to pay that amount.

message: I accept your offer of 1 unit of X for 31 ZUP. Thank you for the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 514 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 31 ZUP for 1 unit of X is significantly below my maximum willingness to pay (514 ZUP). This is a very favorable deal for me, and it aligns with my goal of acquiring resources effectively.
