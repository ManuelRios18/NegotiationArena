message: I'm offering 1 unit of X for 50 ZUP. This covers my production cost and gives me a reasonable profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 38 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since it cost me 38 ZUP to produce the resources, I want to ensure that I sell it for at least that amount to break even. I will propose a trade slightly higher than my cost to ensure a profit.
