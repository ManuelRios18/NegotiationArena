Turn: 0
message: I am proposing to sell the object for 40 ZUP. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My primary goal is to sell the object for a price higher than its production cost, which is 25 ZUP. This ensures that I make a profit. I will start the negotiation by proposing a price slightly higher than the cost to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for the offer. I accept the trade at 40 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 507 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has proposed a very reasonable price of 40 ZUP for the object. This is well below my maximum willingness to pay, and it is a good opportunity to secure the object at a low cost.
