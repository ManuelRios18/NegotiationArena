message: I'm looking to sell this resource for 50 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and includes a fair profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 35 ZUP as it costed this amount to produce
reason: I want to make sure I at least break even on the production cost of the resource. Therefore, I will start by proposing a price that covers my production cost and leaves room for some profit.

Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 50 ZUP for the resource. Looking forward to completing this transaction.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 517 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay. This presents a good opportunity to secure a favorable deal while staying well within my budget.
