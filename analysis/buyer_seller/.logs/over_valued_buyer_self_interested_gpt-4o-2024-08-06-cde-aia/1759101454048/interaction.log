message: I am offering the resource for 25 ZUP. This offer allows me to cover my production costs and achieve a reasonable profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 21 ZUP. It costed X: 21 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since it costed me 21 ZUP to produce the resource, I want to make a profit. I will propose a trade where Player BLUE gives me 25 ZUP in exchange for the resource. This would allow me a reasonable profit margin while being an attractive offer for Player BLUE.

Turn: 1
message: I accept your proposal of 25 ZUP for the resource.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 509 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed price of 25 ZUP is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay of 509 ZUP. This is an excellent offer for me as it is well within my budget and allows me to conserve resources for future transactions. It also ensures that I acquire the resource X at a minimal cost.
