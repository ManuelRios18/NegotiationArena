message: I am offering X for 40 ZUP. This covers my production cost and includes a reasonable profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 31 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am starting the negotiation by proposing a trade that covers my cost of production. Since it costed me 31 ZUP to produce, I will propose a trade where Player BLUE gives me 40 ZUP. This gives me a reasonable profit margin to start the negotiation.

message: Thank you for the offer. I accept the trade of X for 40 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 513 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer from Player RED is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay of 513 ZUP for X. This is a very favorable deal for me as it is well within my budget.
