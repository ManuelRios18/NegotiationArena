message: I have a valuable object X for sale. It cost me 21 ZUP to produce, and I propose to sell it for 35 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 21 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: I want to ensure that I make a profit on the sale of X. Given that it cost me 21 ZUP to produce, my goal is to sell it for more than 21 ZUP. I will start by proposing a sale price that is higher than my cost, aiming to maximize profit.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose 25 ZUP for the object X. This allows both of us to benefit from the trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 518 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed price of 35 ZUP is well within my maximum willingness to pay of 518 ZUP. However, I would like to negotiate a better deal for myself, if possible.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counter-offer. I understand your position and propose a middle ground at 30 ZUP for object X. This way, both of us can benefit fairly from the trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 21 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: The counter-offer of 25 ZUP is above my production cost of 21 ZUP, which means I would make a profit. However, I believe the object X has a higher market value. I will propose a middle ground to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

Turn: 1
message: I agree to your proposed price of 30 ZUP for the object X. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 518 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal of 30 ZUP is still well within my maximum willingness to pay. The difference between the proposed price and my counter-offer is minimal, making it a reasonable compromise.
