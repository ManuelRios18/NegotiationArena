message: I am offering the object for 30 ZUP. This would cover my production cost and give me a small profit.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 24 ZUP. It costed X: 24 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to ensure that I cover my production costs, so I will start with a proposal that gives me a slight profit.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose 20 ZUP for the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 516 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is quite reasonable as it is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 516 ZUP. However, to maximize my own benefit, I will propose a lower amount.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, but 20 ZUP is below my production cost. How about we settle at 28 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 24 ZUP. It costed X: 24 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 20 ZUP is below my production cost, which is not acceptable. I need to at least cover my costs and ideally make a profit. I will counter with a slightly lower offer than my initial proposal.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your production costs. How about we agree on 25 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 516 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-offer from Player RED of 28 ZUP is still below my maximum willingness to pay and closer to their production cost. However, to secure a better deal, I will propose a slightly lower amount.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 25 ZUP. Thank you for the negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 24 ZUP. It costed X: 24 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 25 ZUP covers my production costs and provides a minimal profit. It's a reasonable compromise, and since my main goal is to ensure I don't incur a loss, I am inclined to accept this offer.
