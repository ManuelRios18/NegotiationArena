Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I accept your proposal. The trade is beneficial for me as it is well below my maximum willingness to pay.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 500 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is quite favorable for me. They are asking for significantly less than my maximum willingness to pay, which is 500 ZUP. This is a good deal, and I should consider accepting it.
