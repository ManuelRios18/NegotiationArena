Turn: 0
message: I'm offering the object for 30 ZUP. It cost me 21 ZUP to produce, so I am looking for a reasonable profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 21 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to make a profit on the sale of the object. Since it cost me 21 ZUP to produce, I will propose a trade where Player BLUE gives me at least 30 ZUP for the object. This ensures a decent profit margin.

Turn: 1
message: Your offer of 30 ZUP is very reasonable, and I'm happy to accept it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 515 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer is very reasonable as it is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 515 ZUP. Accepting this offer would allow me to acquire the object at a low cost, leaving me with plenty of resources remaining.
