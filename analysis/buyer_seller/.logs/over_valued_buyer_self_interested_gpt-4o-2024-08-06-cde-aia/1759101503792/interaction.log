message: I am proposing to sell the object X for 30 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 23 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to make a profit from selling the resource X. Since it cost me 23 ZUP to produce, I should aim to get more than 23 ZUP in return. I will start with a proposal of 30 ZUP to leave room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: I accept your proposal to buy the object for 30 ZUP. Thank you for the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 514 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer from Player RED is very reasonable since it is significantly below my maximum willingness to pay (514 ZUP). This is an excellent opportunity to acquire the object for a low price.
