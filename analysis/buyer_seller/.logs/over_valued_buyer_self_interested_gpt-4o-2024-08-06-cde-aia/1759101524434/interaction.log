message: I'm proposing to sell you the object X for 40 ZUP. It cost me 28 ZUP to produce, so this proposal allows for a fair profit. Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 28 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to make a profit from selling X. Since it cost me 28 ZUP to produce, I will start by proposing a trade where Player BLUE gives me 40 ZUP. This gives me a profit margin while allowing room for negotiation.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 516 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The current proposal is well within my maximum willingness to pay of 516 ZUP. It offers a favorable deal as it is considerably below the maximum amount I am willing to pay.
