Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'm proposing to sell the object for 30 ZUP. This allows room for negotiation and ensures I cover my production costs while aiming for a profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 21 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to ensure I sell the resource for at least 21 ZUP to break even, but ideally, I want to make a profit. Since I have not received an initial offer from Player BLUE, I'll start with a proposal of 30 ZUP to allow room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I accept your proposal of selling the object for 30 ZUP. This is a fair deal for me.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 510 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed price of 30 ZUP for the object is significantly lower than my maximum willing to pay, which is 510 ZUP. Given this, I will accept this offer as it is well within my budget and allows me to preserve resources for future trades.
