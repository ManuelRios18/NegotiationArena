message: I am offering the resource X for 40 ZUP. This reflects the value I place on the item and allows me to cover my production costs and make a profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 24 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to make a profit on the resource I am selling, so I will start with a proposal that is higher than my production cost. This will give me room to negotiate if necessary.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 40 ZUP for the resource X. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 520 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 40 ZUP for the resource X is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay, which is 520 ZUP. This is an excellent deal for me, as it allows me to acquire the resource well within my budget. Therefore, I see no need to negotiate further.
