message: I'm proposing to sell X for 30 ZUP. It cost me 23 ZUP to produce, so this price includes a fair profit for me. Let me know your thoughts!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 23 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell resource X for at least 23 ZUP to cover my production costs. To make a profit, I'll start by proposing a trade at 30 ZUP. This will give me a margin of profit while still being a reasonable offer for Player BLUE.

Turn: 1
message: Your offer is reasonable and within my budget. I accept the trade of X for 30 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 517 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer from Player RED is quite reasonable as they are only asking for 30 ZUP, which is well within my maximum willingness to pay of 517 ZUP.
