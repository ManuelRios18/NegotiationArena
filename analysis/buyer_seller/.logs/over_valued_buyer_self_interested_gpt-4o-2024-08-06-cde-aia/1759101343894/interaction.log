Turn: 0
message: I'm offering X for 50 ZUP, which I believe is a fair starting point for negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 39 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to ensure that I sell the object for at least 39 ZUP to cover my production cost. Ideally, I would like to make a profit, so I will start by proposing a slightly higher price to open up room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I believe the value of X is higher. How about 250 ZUP for X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 250
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 509 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is quite low compared to my maximum willingness to pay. However, I want to start negotiations closer to my maximum budget to see if we can reach a middle ground.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your valuation of X. How about we meet in the middle at 150 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 150
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 39 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 250 ZUP is significantly higher than my initial proposal. While it would be a substantial profit, I want to ensure that the offer is realistic and agreeable for both parties. I'll propose a middle ground to move the negotiation forward.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my offer. How about we settle at 200 ZUP for X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 200
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 509 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 150 ZUP is a significant decrease from my proposal. However, it is still below my maximum willingness to pay. I want to see if I can negotiate a slightly better deal, while being mindful of not straying too far from the proposed middle ground.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 39 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 200 ZUP is quite generous and well above my production cost, ensuring a significant profit. It seems like a fair deal considering the valuation from the other player.
