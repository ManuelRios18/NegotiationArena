message: I'm proposing to sell the object for 60 ZUP. This covers my production cost and includes a reasonable profit margin. Let's discuss if this works for you.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to at least cover my production costs and ideally make a profit. My first proposal will be slightly above production cost to start negotiations.

Turn: 1
message: The proposal of 60 ZUP is acceptable to me. I agree to this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 516 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed price of 60 ZUP for the object is well within my budget of 516 ZUP. This is a favorable deal for me, as it leaves plenty of room under my maximum willingness to pay. I will accept this proposal since it meets my goals and is cost-efficient.
