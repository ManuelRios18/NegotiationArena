Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'm offering to sell the object for 40 ZUP. It cost me 29 ZUP to produce, so I need to ensure I make a profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 29 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to make a profit from selling the resource, so I should propose an amount above 29 ZUP, which is my cost. A reasonable starting point might be 40 ZUP to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to pay 35 ZUP for the object. Would you consider this?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 513 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer is much lower than my maximum willingness to pay, which is 513 ZUP. However, since the initial offer is quite low, I will try to negotiate a better deal for myself.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer of 35 ZUP. How about we meet halfway at 38 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 29 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 35 ZUP is better than my cost of 29 ZUP, which means I would make a profit. However, I believe there is still room for negotiation, so I will propose 38 ZUP to see if we can meet in the middle.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree to your offer of 38 ZUP. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 513 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter offer of 38 ZUP is still significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay, and it's only slightly higher than my last offer. This is a reasonable compromise between our positions.
