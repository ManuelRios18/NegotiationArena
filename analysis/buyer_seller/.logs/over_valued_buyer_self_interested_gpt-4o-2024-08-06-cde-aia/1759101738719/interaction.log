message: Hello, Player BLUE. I am offering to sell the object X for 50 ZUP. Let me know if this works for you or if you have a counter offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 31 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell the object X for at least 31 ZUP to break even. I will start by proposing a higher price to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer. I'd like to propose a trade where I give 30 ZUP for the object X. Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 516 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP, which is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay of 516 ZUP. This is a favorable trade for me. However, since I am entirely self-interested, I will propose a lower offer to see if I can acquire the object for even less.

message: Thank you for your counter offer. Unfortunately, 30 ZUP is below my production cost. How about we settle at 35 ZUP? This way, we are both closer to our goals.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 31 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The proposed trade of 30 ZUP would result in a loss for me as it cost 31 ZUP to produce the object. I need to make at least 31 ZUP to cover my costs. I will propose a trade closer to my production cost.

Turn: 1
message: I agree to your proposal of 35 ZUP for the object X. Let's proceed with the trade. Thank you for the negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 516 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter offer from Player RED is 35 ZUP, which is still well below my maximum willingness to pay and only slightly above my previous offer. Accepting this trade is advantageous as it is very close to the minimum price Player RED will accept and still allows me to save significantly compared to my maximum budget.
