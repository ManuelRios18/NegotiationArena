Turn: 0
message: I am proposing to sell the object for 30 ZUP. This will ensure a small profit over the production cost.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 28 ZUP. It costed X: 28 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to ensure that I at least break even on this trade, so my minimum acceptable offer is 28 ZUP.
proposal count: 0

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer of 30 ZUP. However, I would like to propose 20 ZUP for the object. This would help me manage my resources more efficiently.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 510 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The current offer is well under my maximum willingness to pay, which is 510 ZUP. Given this, I can afford to negotiate for a lower price to maximize my remaining resources.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your need to manage resources. However, 28 ZUP is my minimum due to production costs. Can we agree on that?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 28 ZUP. It costed X: 28 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The proposed 20 ZUP is below my production cost, and accepting it would result in a loss. I need to negotiate closer to my cost price.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your constraints and appreciate your flexibility. Could we agree on 25 ZUP? This would make it more feasible for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 510 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed price of 28 ZUP is quite reasonable and still much lower than my maximum willingness to pay of 510 ZUP. However, I will attempt one more negotiation to see if a slightly better deal can be achieved.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 25 ZUP, but I cannot go below 28 ZUP due to production costs. Can we settle on 28 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 28 ZUP. It costed X: 28 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 25 ZUP is closer to my minimum, it still results in a loss for me. I need to either negotiate upwards or decide to reject if we can't reach 28 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your patience. I agree to the trade at 28 ZUP. Looking forward to completing this transaction.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 510 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has reiterated their minimum price of 28 ZUP, which is still well below my maximum willingness to pay. Given their constraints and my goal of acquiring the object, I find it reasonable to accept this offer.
