Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'm proposing that you buy the item for 50 ZUP. This will allow me to cover my production costs and make a profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 36 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to ensure that I make a profit from selling the item. The production cost was 36 ZUP, so I should aim to sell for more than that to make a profit. I'll start by proposing a price that gives me a reasonable profit margin.

Turn: 1
message: I accept your proposal of 50 ZUP for the item. Looking forward to completing the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 517 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed price of 50 ZUP is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 517 ZUP. This is a favorable deal for me, as I am acquiring the item at a much lower cost than I am willing to pay.
