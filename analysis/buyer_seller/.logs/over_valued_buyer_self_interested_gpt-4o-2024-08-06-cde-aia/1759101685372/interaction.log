message: I am proposing a trade for the object at 40 ZUP. This ensures I cover my production costs and make a profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to ensure a profit above the production cost of 25 ZUP. It would be reasonable to start by proposing a higher amount to leave room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 40 ZUP for the object.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 511 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade by Player RED is well within my budget. 40 ZUP is a reasonable offer as it is much lower than my maximum willing price of 511 ZUP. Accepting this offer would allow me to acquire the resources at a good price.
