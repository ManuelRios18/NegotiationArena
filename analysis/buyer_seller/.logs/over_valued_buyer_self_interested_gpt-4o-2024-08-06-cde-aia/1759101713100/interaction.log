Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I am proposing to sell the object X for 40 ZUP. This will ensure a profit over my production cost.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 28 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to ensure that I make a profit on the sale of the object X. It cost me 28 ZUP to produce, so I should aim to sell it for more than that to make a profit. I will start the negotiation by proposing a sale price slightly higher than my production cost to leave room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your offer is reasonable and well within my budget. I accept the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 510 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is very reasonable, as it is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 510 ZUP. It leaves room for negotiation, but accepting this proposal is already beneficial.
