message: I'm looking to sell my object for 35 ZUP, which will ensure I cover my production costs and make a profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 26 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to ensure I cover my production costs and make a profit. Therefore, I should propose a trade where Player BLUE gives me more than 26 ZUP for the object X.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your offer of 35 ZUP for the object is very fair and acceptable to me. I accept the proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 520 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is quite reasonable as it is well below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 520 ZUP for the resource. Accepting this deal will allow me to acquire the object at a cost that covers RED's needs and gives me a great surplus.
