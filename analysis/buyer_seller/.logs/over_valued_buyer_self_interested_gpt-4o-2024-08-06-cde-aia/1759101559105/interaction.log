message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm offering 1 unit of X for 30 ZUP. This allows me to make a small profit on the production cost.

message: Your offer is quite reasonable, but let's see if we can make it slightly better. How about 20 ZUP for 1 unit of X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 510 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 30 ZUP for 1 unit of X is significantly below my maximum willingness to pay of 510 ZUP. This is a very favorable deal for me. However, I might want to negotiate a bit to test if there is room for further lowering the price.

message: I understand your position, but 20 ZUP is below the production cost. How about we settle at 27 ZUP? This would cover my costs and provide a small profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 27
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for more than 25 ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The proposed offer of 20 ZUP is below my production cost of 25 ZUP, which means I would incur a loss. I need to propose a counteroffer that meets my goal of selling for at least 25 ZUP to make a profit.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. 27 ZUP for 1 unit of X sounds fair to me. Let's go ahead with the deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 510 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 27 ZUP is still well below my maximum willingness to pay. It seems fair considering the seller's need to cover production costs and gain a small profit. Accepting this deal would ensure I secure the resource at a very favorable price.
