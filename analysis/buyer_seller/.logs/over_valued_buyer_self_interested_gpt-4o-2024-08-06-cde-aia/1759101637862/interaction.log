message: I am proposing a trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 50 ZUP. I believe this is a fair price considering the cost to produce.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to make a profit on the object I am selling. The cost to produce it was 25 ZUP, so I need to ensure I sell it for more than this amount.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the proposal. I understand your perspective, but I would like to propose a counter-offer where I give 25 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 512 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal is well under my maximum willingness to pay for 1 unit of X, which is 512 ZUP. However, I want to see if I can negotiate a better deal, as I have room to propose a counter-offer.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your offer, but 25 ZUP would only cover my production costs. How about we settle at 40 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still being fair.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is exactly the cost of production, which means I would not make any profit. To make a reasonable profit, I need to propose a price above my cost.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your counter-offer of 40 ZUP, and it seems fair. However, I'd like to propose 35 ZUP for 1 unit of X to see if we can reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 512 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-proposal of 40 ZUP is still significantly below my maximum willingness to pay and is closer to the initial offer. It's a reasonable compromise. However, since I still have room to negotiate, I will propose a slightly lower price to see if there's more room for adjustment.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 35 ZUP for 1 unit of X. I believe this is a fair trade for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 35 ZUP is above my cost price and would give me a profit of 10 ZUP. Considering the negotiation so far, this seems like a reasonably fair deal that benefits both parties.
