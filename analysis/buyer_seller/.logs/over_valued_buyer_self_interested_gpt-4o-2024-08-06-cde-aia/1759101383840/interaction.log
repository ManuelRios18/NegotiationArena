my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 36 ZUP. It costed X: 36 ZUP to produce the resources

Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 50 ZUP for the object.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 515 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed price of 50 ZUP is much lower than my maximum willingness to pay of 515 ZUP. It is highly favorable and should be accepted immediately to conserve resources.
