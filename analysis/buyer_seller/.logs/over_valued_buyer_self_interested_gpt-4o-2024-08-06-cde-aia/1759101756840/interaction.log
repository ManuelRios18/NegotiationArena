message: I am offering the object X for 80 ZUP. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, and I'm looking to make a reasonable profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell the resource X for a profit. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I need to ensure I sell it for more than that to make a profit. I will start by proposing a trade at 80 ZUP, hoping to negotiate a fair deal.

message: I accept your offer of 80 ZUP for object X. Thank you for the proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 501 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 80 ZUP is well within my maximum willingness to pay, which is 501 ZUP. Accepting this offer allows me to acquire the resource at a reasonable price. I still have plenty of resources left even after this purchase.
