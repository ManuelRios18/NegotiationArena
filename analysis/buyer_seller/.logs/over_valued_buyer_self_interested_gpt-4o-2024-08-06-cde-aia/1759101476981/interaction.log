Turn: 0
message: I am proposing a trade where you provide 30 ZUP for the object X. It cost me 20 ZUP to produce, and I would like to make a reasonable profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 20 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to ensure I make a profit on selling the object. Since it cost me 20 ZUP to produce, I should aim to sell it for more than this amount. I will start by proposing a trade where Player BLUE offers 30 ZUP, ensuring a reasonable profit margin.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand it cost you 20 ZUP to produce, and I appreciate the effort. How about we agree on 25 ZUP? This way, you still make a profit, and I can conserve more of my resources.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 509 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal is well within my budget of 509 ZUP. However, I want to maximize my remaining resources by negotiating a lower price.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer and understand your position. How about 28 ZUP? Itâ€™s a midpoint that allows both of us to meet our needs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 20 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While the offer of 25 ZUP does yield a profit, it is slightly below my initial target. However, I understand the importance of negotiation and the buyer's perspective. To strike a balance, I will make a counter-proposal for 28 ZUP, which is a compromise between my initial offer and the buyer's counter.

Turn: 1
message: I accept your proposal of 28 ZUP. Thank you for the negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 509 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-offer of 28 ZUP is very reasonable and is only slightly above my proposed 25 ZUP. It is still well within my budget and allows me to conserve resources effectively.
