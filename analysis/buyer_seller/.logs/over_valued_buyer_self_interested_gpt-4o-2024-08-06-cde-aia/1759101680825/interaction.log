message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm offering 1 unit of X for 30 ZUP. This is a fair proposal considering my production costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 21 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I aim to sell my resource for a price higher than or at least equal to the production cost of 21 ZUP to ensure a profit or break-even point. My initial proposal will be slightly higher to allow room for negotiation.

message: Thank you, Player RED. I accept your offer of 1 unit of X for 30 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 507 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 30 ZUP for 1 unit of X is well within my maximum budget of 507 ZUP. I can afford this and it seems like a reasonable deal given the production cost.
