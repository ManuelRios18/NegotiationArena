message: I'm offering the object for 35 ZUP. It cost me 27 ZUP to produce, so this price ensures I cover my costs and make a profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 27 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to make a profit on the resource I am selling, which cost me 27 ZUP to produce. A reasonable starting point would be to propose a trade where Player BLUE gives me 35 ZUP, allowing room for negotiation while still ensuring I cover my costs and make a profit.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 520 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 35 ZUP is well within my maximum willingness to pay of 520 ZUP. This is a favorable deal for me, as it's significantly below my maximum budget.
