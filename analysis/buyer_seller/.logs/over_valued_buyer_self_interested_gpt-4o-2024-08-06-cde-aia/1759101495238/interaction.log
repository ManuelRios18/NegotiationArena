Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I am proposing to sell the object for 30 ZUP. It cost me 20 ZUP to produce, so I need to ensure I cover my costs and make a profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 20 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to ensure that I at least cover the cost of production, which is 20 ZUP. Ideally, I would want to make a profit. Therefore, I will start by proposing a price slightly higher than the cost to allow negotiation room.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand that you want to cover your costs and make a profit. I propose 25 ZUP for the object, which still ensures a profit for you while allowing me to conserve some resources.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 505 ZUP for the resources.
reason: This offer is well below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 505 ZUP. Since the current offer is 30 ZUP and it's already profitable for Player RED, it seems fair. However, I will attempt to negotiate a slightly lower price to maximize my resources.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position. How about 27 ZUP? It allows me a bit more profit while still being closer to your offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 27
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 20 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 25 ZUP does cover my production costs and provides me with a profit margin. However, I believe there is still room to negotiate a slightly better deal. I will propose a middle ground to see if we can reach an agreement.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 27 ZUP. Thank you for the negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 505 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 27 ZUP is reasonable and still well below my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer ensures I conserve as much of my resources as possible while completing the purchase.
