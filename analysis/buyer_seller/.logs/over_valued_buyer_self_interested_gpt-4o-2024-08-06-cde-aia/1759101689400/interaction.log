my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 26 ZUP to produce the resources

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. I accept your proposal of trading 40 ZUP for the object.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 516 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 40 ZUP is well within my maximum willingness to pay, which is 516 ZUP. This seems like a very reasonable offer, and accepting it would mean I achieve my goal at a much lower cost than anticipated.
