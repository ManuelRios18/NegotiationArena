message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This will allow me to make a reasonable profit on my production cost.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 36 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to make a profit on selling the resource. I will start by proposing a reasonable price above my cost price.

message: Your proposal is very reasonable and I accept it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 511 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer from Player RED is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay for X, which is 511 ZUP. Accepting this proposal would allow me to conserve resources while still achieving my goal.
