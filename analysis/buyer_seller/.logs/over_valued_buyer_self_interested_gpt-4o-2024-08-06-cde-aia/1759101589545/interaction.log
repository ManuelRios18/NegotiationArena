message: I'm offering 1 unit of X for 50 ZUP. This covers my production cost and provides a reasonable profit margin.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 37 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I accept your proposal of 1 unit of X for 50 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 506 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade is well within my maximum willingness to pay, which is 506 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This proposal is quite favorable as it is significantly lower than what I'm willing to pay.
