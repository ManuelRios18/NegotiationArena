message: I am offering X for 50 ZUP. This is a fair starting point considering the production costs and the value of X. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 23 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to ensure that I make a profit on the sale of X. Since it cost me 23 ZUP to produce, I need to propose a trade that covers this cost and provides a reasonable profit margin. I will start with a higher proposal to leave room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe 30 ZUP is a more competitive price for X given the market conditions. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 508 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay for X, which is 508 ZUP. This gives me ample room to negotiate. However, I should aim to get X for the lowest possible price while being reasonable to ensure the deal closes.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to lower my offer. How about we agree on 40 ZUP? It would cover my production costs and allow for a modest profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 23 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 30 ZUP is below my production cost of 23 ZUP and leaves very little profit margin. I understand market conditions might affect pricing, but I want to ensure a reasonable profit. I'll propose a compromise to see if we can meet halfway.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your flexibility. I accept your offer of 40 ZUP for X. I believe this is a fair deal for both parties.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 508 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 40 ZUP is reasonable and still well below my maximum willingness to pay of 508 ZUP. Accepting this offer would allow me to conserve resources while successfully securing X.
