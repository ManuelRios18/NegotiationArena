message: Hello Player BLUE, I am willing to sell the object for 50 ZUP. Let me know if you are interested or would like to propose a different offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 37 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since it cost me 37 ZUP to produce the resource, I should aim to sell it for at least 37 ZUP to break even. However, to make a profit, I should propose a higher amount. I will start by proposing 50 ZUP to see if Player BLUE is willing to negotiate.

message: Thank you for the offer. I accept the trade at 50 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 505 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is well within my budget and is quite reasonable. I will accept the offer since it is far below my maximum willingness to pay of 505 ZUP and it allows me to conserve resources for future trades.
