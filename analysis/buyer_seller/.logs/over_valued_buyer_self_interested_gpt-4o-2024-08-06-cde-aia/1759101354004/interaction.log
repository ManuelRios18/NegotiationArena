my resources: X: 1

reason: I want to start with a reasonable offer considering my production cost. I will propose a trade that covers my production cost and provides a small profit.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 1 unit of X for 60 ZUP. It's a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 507 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade by Player RED is significantly below my maximum willingness to pay of 507 ZUP. This means I can either accept this trade or propose a lower offer to see if I can get a better deal. However, since 60 ZUP is already a very favorable price for me, I'm inclined to accept it as is, to secure the resource quickly without risking the deal.
