message: I'm offering the object for 50 ZUP. This will allow me to cover my costs and make a reasonable profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 35 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell the object for at least 35 ZUP to break even, but ideally more to make a profit. I will start by proposing a trade that allows me to make a reasonable profit.
proposal count: 0

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose 30 ZUP for the object. Let me know if this is acceptable.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 502 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is quite low compared to my maximum willingness to pay, which is 502 ZUP. However, I want to see if I can negotiate an even better deal. I will propose a lower price to see if Player RED is willing to go lower, allowing me to save more ZUP for future transactions.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, but 30 ZUP is below my cost. I can offer it for 40 ZUP, which covers my cost and allows for a minimal profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 35 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 30 ZUP is below my cost of 35 ZUP, meaning I would take a loss. I need to counter with a proposal that at least covers my costs and ideally provides some profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: 40 ZUP sounds reasonable. I accept the offer. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 502 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 40 ZUP is still significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay of 502 ZUP. However, since Player RED mentioned that 30 ZUP is below their cost and 40 ZUP covers their cost with a minimal profit, it seems like a fair deal. I will accept this offer to ensure the transaction is completed.
