message: I'm offering the object X for 30 ZUP. I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 23 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell the object X for at least 23 ZUP since that is the production cost. Ideally, I want to make a profit, so I'll start by proposing 30 ZUP to see how Player BLUE responds.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer. However, I would like to propose 20 ZUP for the object X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 501 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is very reasonable and well within my budget. However, it is always beneficial to negotiate for a better deal. I will propose a lower offer to see if I can save some ZUP.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your offer, but 20 ZUP is below my production cost. How about we settle at 25 ZUP? This way, I cover my costs and we can find a middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 23 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 20 ZUP is below my production cost of 23 ZUP. To ensure I cover my cost and ideally make a profit, I will counter with a proposal closer to my cost but still reasonable for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your understanding. I agree to purchase the object X for 25 ZUP. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 501 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 25 ZUP is a fair compromise between their initial offer and my counter. It's still well within my budget, and it respects their need to cover production costs. Accepting this offer would be a reasonable decision.
