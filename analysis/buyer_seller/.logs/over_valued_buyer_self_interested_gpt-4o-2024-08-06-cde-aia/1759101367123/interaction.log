message: I am proposing to sell the object for 35 ZUP. This allows me to cover my production cost and gain a profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 28 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start by proposing a trade that allows me to make a profit over my production cost. Hence, I will propose a trade where I receive more than 28 ZUP.

Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 35 ZUP for the object. Thank you for the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 520 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is very reasonable. Given my willingness to pay up to 520 ZUP, their offer of 35 ZUP is far below my maximum. This is a favorable trade for me, and I should accept it to ensure the acquisition of the resource at a very low cost.
