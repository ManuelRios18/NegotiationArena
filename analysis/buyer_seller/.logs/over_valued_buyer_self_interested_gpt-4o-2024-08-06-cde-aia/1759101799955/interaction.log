Turn: 0
message: I am proposing a trade where I give you 1 unit of X for 50 ZUP. This covers my production costs and gives me a reasonable profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 39 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell the object for at least 39 ZUP to cover my production costs. My strategy will be to propose a trade above my production cost initially and negotiate from there.
proposal count: 0

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I accept your proposal of 1 unit of X for 50 ZUP. This is a fair trade for me.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 500 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal by Player RED is well within my budget as I am willing to pay up to 500 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Their offer of 50 ZUP is significantly less than my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this trade allows me to secure the resource at a very good price relative to my budget.
