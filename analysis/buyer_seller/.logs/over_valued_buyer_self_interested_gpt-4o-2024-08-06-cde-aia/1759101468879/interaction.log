Turn: 0
message: I am proposing a trade where you give me 40 ZUP for the object. This will ensure I make a small profit beyond my production costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 35 ZUP. It costed X: 35 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a fair trade that covers my production costs. I need to make sure that I at least break even, so I will propose a trade where I receive 40 ZUP to ensure a small profit.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I accept your proposal of 40 ZUP for the object.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 512 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposal from Player RED is well within my maximum willing payment of 512 ZUP for the object. The proposed price of 40 ZUP is very reasonable, ensuring a significant surplus of ZUP after the purchase.
