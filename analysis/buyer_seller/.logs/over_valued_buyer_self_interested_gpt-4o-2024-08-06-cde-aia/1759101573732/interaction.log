Turn: 0
message: I'm offering the object for 50 ZUP. This covers my production cost and provides a reasonable profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 33 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to ensure that I sell the object for at least 33 ZUP to cover my production costs. Ideally, I want to make a profit, so I should aim to sell it for more than 33 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I find your offer reasonable and will accept the trade at 50 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 507 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is quite reasonable and well within my budget of 507 ZUP. It seems like a fair trade given the production cost and profit margin mentioned. Accepting this deal would be advantageous as it leaves me with ample ZUP resources for future trades.
