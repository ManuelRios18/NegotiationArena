message: I'm offering the object for 50 ZUP, considering production costs and desired profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 34 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to make a profit on the resource I am selling. Since it cost me 34 ZUP to produce, I should aim to sell it for more than 34 ZUP. I'll start by proposing a reasonable amount above the cost price to give room for negotiation.
