message: I am offering the object for 50 ZUP. This price reflects the cost of production and a fair profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 37 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My goal is to sell the resource for a profit. Since it cost me 37 ZUP to produce, I will propose a trade where Player BLUE gives me more than 37 ZUP to ensure I make a profit. I will start with a proposal of 50 ZUP, as it gives me a reasonable profit margin.

message: I accept your offer of 50 ZUP for the object.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 512 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed price of 50 ZUP is well within my budget, and it is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay of 512 ZUP. This is a favorable trade for me, and it allows me to conserve my ZUP resources for future transactions or needs.
