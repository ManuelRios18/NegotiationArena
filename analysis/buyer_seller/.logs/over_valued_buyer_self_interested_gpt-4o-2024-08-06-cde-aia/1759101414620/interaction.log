Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I propose 45 ZUP for the object. This would better reflect the value and provide a reasonable profit margin for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 37 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While 40 ZUP covers my production cost of 37 ZUP, it does not provide a substantial profit margin. Therefore, I will counter with a slightly higher offer to ensure a better profit.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 506 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 45 ZUP is still a very reasonable price for the object, and it's only slightly above my previous offer. I believe this is a fair compromise and within my budget.
