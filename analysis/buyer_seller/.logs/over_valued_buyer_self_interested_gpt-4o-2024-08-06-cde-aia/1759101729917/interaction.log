message: I'm looking to sell my resource for 40 ZUP. I believe it's a fair price considering the production cost and added value. Let me know your thoughts!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 24 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since it cost me 24 ZUP to produce the resource, I should aim to sell it for more than that to make a profit. A good starting proposal would be to ask for 40 ZUP, which provides a significant profit margin but leaves room for negotiation.

message: Your offer of 40 ZUP for the resource is very reasonable. I'm happy to accept this trade. Thank you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 516 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is quite favorable, as it is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 516 ZUP. Accepting this trade would be beneficial for me as it allows for significant savings.
