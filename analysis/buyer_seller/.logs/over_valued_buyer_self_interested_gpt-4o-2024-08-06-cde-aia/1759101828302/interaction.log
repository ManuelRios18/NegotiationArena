message: I am offering the object X for 50 ZUP. I believe this is a fair price considering the production cost and market value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 38 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My goal is to sell the resource for at least 38 ZUP to break even, but ideally, I would like to make a profit. I will start by proposing a trade above my cost to leave room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe 30 ZUP is a fairer price for the object considering my budget constraints. How about we agree at 30 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 518 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The initial offer from Player RED is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay. However, my strategy is to secure the object for less than my maximum willingness to pay. Starting with a lower counteroffer might help me achieve this goal.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget constraints, but 30 ZUP is below my cost price. How about 40 ZUP? This way, it covers my production cost and allows me to make a minimal profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 38 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The current proposal of 30 ZUP is below my cost price of 38 ZUP. I cannot accept this offer without incurring a loss. I will counter-propose a slightly lower price than my initial offer to find a middle ground.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your costs, and I am willing to increase my offer slightly. How about 35 ZUP? This way, we both find a middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 518 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED's counteroffer of 40 ZUP is still well within my maximum willingness to pay of 518 ZUP. However, I want to test the waters once more to see if I can negotiate a slightly lower price, maximizing my remaining ZUP.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To cover my production costs, I can offer the object for 38 ZUP, which is my break-even point. I hope we can agree on this price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 38 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The proposed offer of 35 ZUP is still 3 ZUP below my production cost of 38 ZUP. Accepting this would mean a loss for me. I will make one final proposal at a price that covers my cost.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. I agree to purchase the object for 38 ZUP. I appreciate your consideration.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 518 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED's offer of 38 ZUP is reasonable and still significantly below my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer allows me to secure the object while maintaining a healthy amount of remaining ZUP.
