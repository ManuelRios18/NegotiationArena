message: I'm willing to sell the object for 60 ZUP, which includes a profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My goal is to sell the object for an amount higher than 40 ZUP to make a profit. I'll start with a reasonable proposal that acknowledges the cost and adds a profit margin.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your offer of 60 ZUP is acceptable. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 515 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is well within my maximum willingness to pay, which is 515 ZUP for the object. Since the price is only 60 ZUP, this is an excellent deal for me and allows me to conserve resources.
