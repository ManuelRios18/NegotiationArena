message: Hi Player RED, your offer is quite reasonable, but I would like to propose a counter-offer of 30 ZUP. Let me know what you think.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 509 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is quite favorable, as it is significantly below my maximum willingness to pay. I will propose a negotiation to see if a more advantageous price is possible.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. However, 30 ZUP is below my cost price. I propose we settle at 40 ZUP, which is a fair midpoint between our initial offers.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 32 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's proposal of 30 ZUP is below my cost price of 32 ZUP. I cannot accept this offer as it would result in a loss. I will propose a counter-offer closer to my cost price to continue the negotiation.

message: I accept your offer of 40 ZUP for the object X. Thank you for the negotiation!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 509 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counter-offer of 40 ZUP is reasonable and quite fair, especially since it's only slightly higher than my counter-offer. Since it's still well below my maximum willingness to pay, it's a good deal for me.
