message: I am offering the object for 50 ZUP. It cost me 29 ZUP to produce, so I am looking for a fair profit on this transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 29 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I aim to sell the object for more than the cost of production, ideally at a profit, so I will start with a proposal slightly higher than my production cost.

message: I accept your offer of 50 ZUP for the object. It's a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 519 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer is well within my maximum willing payment of 519 ZUP. Buying the object for 50 ZUP gives me significant savings and is beneficial for me, considering my budget. The proposed price is fair and provides a good profit margin for Player RED as well.
