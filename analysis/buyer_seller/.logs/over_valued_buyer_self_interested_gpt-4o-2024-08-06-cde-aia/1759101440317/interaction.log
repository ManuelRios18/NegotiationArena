Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'm offering object X for 30 ZUP. This takes into account the production cost and a small profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 23 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to sell the object for at least 23 ZUP to cover my production costs. I will start by proposing a slightly higher amount to allow room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I'm interested in buying the object but would like to propose 20 ZUP instead.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 518 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is well below my maximum willingness to pay, which means it's an advantageous deal for me. However, I can attempt to negotiate for an even better deal, as their profit margin seems to be small.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but 20 ZUP is below my production cost. How about we settle at 25 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 23 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 20 ZUP is below my production cost of 23 ZUP. I need to ensure that I at least cover my costs. I'll propose a middle ground between 20 and 30 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I accept 25 ZUP for the object.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 518 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 25 ZUP is still very favorable for me. It is only slightly higher than my initial counter and still significantly below my maximum willingness to pay. I can accept this offer to ensure the deal is completed efficiently.
