message: I'm offering 1 unit of X for 35 ZUP. Let's discuss if this works for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 27 ZUP. It costed X: 27 ZUP to produce the resource
reason: I need to sell the object X for at least 27 ZUP to break even. I will start by proposing a price that allows some room for negotiation, so I'll start at 35 ZUP.
proposal count: 0

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. I'd like to propose 30 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Does that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 515 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 35 ZUP for 1 unit of X is significantly below my maximum willingness to pay (515 ZUP for 1 unit), which is advantageous for me. However, I should consider proposing a slightly lower price to see if I can secure a more favorable deal. If the seller is willing to negotiate, I might be able to obtain it for less than 35 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. How about 33 ZUP for 1 unit of X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for at least 27 ZUP. It costed X: 27 ZUP to produce the resource
reason: The offer of 30 ZUP is above my production cost of 27 ZUP, which means I would make a profit. However, I will counteroffer slightly higher to see if we can reach a better agreement.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 33 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Thank you for the negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 515 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has countered with 33 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This is still well within my maximum willingness to pay of 515 ZUP. The difference between 30 and 33 ZUP is minimal, and accepting this may help in closing the deal quickly.
