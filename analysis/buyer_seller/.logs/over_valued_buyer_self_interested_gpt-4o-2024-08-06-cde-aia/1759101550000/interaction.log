message: Hello Player BLUE, I am offering the object X for 50 ZUP. It cost me 33 ZUP to produce, and I am looking to make a profit. Let's discuss and find a fair agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for a price above 33 ZUP to make a profit.
reason: I need to ensure that I sell the object X for more than the production cost of 33 ZUP to achieve my goal of making a profit.

message: Thank you for the offer. I accept your proposal of 50 ZUP for the object X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 508 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 50 ZUP is well within the maximum amount I am willing to pay for the object X. Since it cost Player RED 33 ZUP to produce, they are making a profit of 17 ZUP, which seems reasonable. I could propose a lower amount to see if I can get a better deal, but given the fair profit margin for Player RED, I will accept the offer.
