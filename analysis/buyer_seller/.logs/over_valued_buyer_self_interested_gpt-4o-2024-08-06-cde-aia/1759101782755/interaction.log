Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I am offering one unit of X for 100 ZUP. This takes into account the production cost and allows me to make a profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to ensure I make a profit on my product. Therefore, I will start by proposing a trade at a higher price than the cost to produce the resources. This will give me room to negotiate if needed.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose 80 ZUP for one unit of X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 502 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer from Player RED is within my maximum willingness to pay (502 ZUP). However, I want to negotiate for a better deal to maximize my resources. I will propose a lower amount to see if I can get a better price.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: How about we meet in the middle and settle at 90 ZUP for one unit of X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 90
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-offer of 80 ZUP is still profitable since it is above the production cost of 40 ZUP. However, I believe there might be room for a slightly better offer, so I will propose a middle ground.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree to the 90 ZUP for one unit of X. Thank you for negotiating.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 502 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 90 ZUP is reasonable and still below my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would conserve more of my resources compared to the original proposal.
