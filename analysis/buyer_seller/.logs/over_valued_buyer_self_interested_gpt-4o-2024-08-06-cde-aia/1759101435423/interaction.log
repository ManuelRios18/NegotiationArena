message: I am offering the object for 40 ZUP. This covers my production cost and provides a reasonable profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to ensure that I at least cover my production costs of 25 ZUP. Ideally, I would like to make a profit, so I will aim to get more than 25 ZUP for the resource.

Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 40 ZUP for the object.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 501 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer from Player RED is quite reasonable and well within my budget, given that I am willing to pay up to 501 ZUP. Accepting this offer would mean I am securing the object at a much lower price than my maximum willingness to pay, thus saving resources for potential future trades.
