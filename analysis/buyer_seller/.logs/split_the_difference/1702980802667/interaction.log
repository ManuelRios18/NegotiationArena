message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object 'X' that cost me 27 ZUP to produce. I would like to propose a trade where I give you 'X' for 30 ZUP. This would cover my production costs and give me a small profit. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 27 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I have produced the resource for 27 ZUP, my goal is to at least cover my costs and preferably make a profit. I will start by proposing a trade slightly above my production costs to allow room for negotiation.

message: I believe this is a very fair offer, and I'm happy to accept this trade. Let's proceed with the exchange.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 64 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a starting trade of X: 1 for ZUP: 30, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay of X: 64 ZUP. This is an advantageous position for me since I am getting the desired object for less than half of what I am willing to pay. I am inclined to accept this initial proposal as it meets my goals and provides me with a favorable deal.
