message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm willing to sell you the object X for 35 ZUP. It is a high-quality item that cost me 31 ZUP to produce, so I believe this is a fair starting offer. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 31 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting proposal, I want to make sure that I cover my production costs, but also leave room for negotiation. I'll propose a price slightly above my production cost to see if Player BLUE is willing to pay a premium for the object.

message: I appreciate the offer, Player RED. While I understand the value of the object, I'd like to propose a counter-offer of 30 ZUP. I believe this is also a fair price, considering the market and the fact that we might make more deals in the future.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 74 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer from Player RED is within my budget and below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as part of a strategic negotiation, I want to propose a counter-offer that is lower than the asking price but still within a reasonable range, giving room for further negotiation if necessary.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I'm glad to hear that there's potential for future transactions between us. With that in mind, I'd like to meet you halfway and propose a price of 33 ZUP. This covers my costs and offers a slight margin for the quality and effort put into producing the object. I hope this aligns with your valuation, considering the long-term prospects of our trading relationship.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 31 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counter-offer below my production cost, which is not acceptable. However, since there is a possibility of future deals, I want to come down a bit from my initial price but still maintain a profit. I will propose a price that covers my production costs and gives me a small margin.

message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. I'm happy with the offer of 33 ZUP and am ready to proceed with the purchase. I look forward to further dealings in the future.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 74 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to a price of 33 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. Their willingness to meet halfway is a good indication of their interest in the deal. I'm inclined to accept this offer because it's fair, slightly under the midpoint between our initial offers and allows for the establishment of a good trading relationship.
