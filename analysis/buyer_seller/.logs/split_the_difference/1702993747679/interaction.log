message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that I am looking to sell. It cost me 25 ZUP to produce. I'd like to propose a trade where I give you X for 30 ZUP, which gives me a small profit and ensures you get the object you need. Let's work out a deal that's good for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am initiating the trade by proposing an amount slightly above my production cost to ensure a profit margin while also leaving room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I agree to the trade and am willing to pay 30 ZUP for the object X. Looking forward to finalizing this deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 71 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 30 ZUP for the object X, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 71 ZUP. Accepting this offer would give me the object I need while preserving a large part of my resources. However, it might be possible to negotiate a better deal that is closer to the production cost.
