my resources: X: 1

message: Thanks for the offer, Player RED. I understand that the resource X is of high quality. Considering the production cost and the value, I'd like to propose a trade for 40 ZUP. This ensures a profit for you and a fair purchase price for me. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 67 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP which is below my maximum willingness to pay of 67 ZUP. However, the goal in a negotiation is to try and obtain the best possible deal. Since Player RED has disclosed the cost of production as 35 ZUP, there is room to propose a lower price that still ensures a profit for Player RED while saving me some ZUP. I will propose a price closer to their cost to try and find middle ground.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I am glad we're progressing towards an agreement. I propose a slight adjustment to 45 ZUP. This price provides you with a valuable resource while also giving me a reasonable profit margin. How does that sound to you?

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 35 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 40 ZUP, which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. I want to counter with a price closer to my asking price but still offer a discount to move towards a mutually acceptable deal.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. Meeting halfway, how about we settle on 42 ZUP? This price still grants you a profit over the production cost and remains within a reasonable range for me. Looking forward to finding a middle ground that is agreeable to both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 67 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I believe there is still room for negotiation, and it might be possible to agree on a price that is even more favorable to me. I will propose a value that is halfway between my initial offer and Player RED's counteroffer.

message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Player BLUE. I value our effort to reach an amicable agreement. I suggest we meet a bit closer to my last proposal at 43 ZUP. This price reflects the quality of the resource while also respecting your budget constraints. Let's finalize this deal and both benefit from it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 35 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 42 ZUP, which is closer to my last proposal. Considering this is a negotiation, there's room to meet even closer to the middle. I should make one more counteroffer that is slightly above Player BLUE's offer to maximize profit while moving towards closure on the deal.

message: Thank you for your understanding and flexibility, Player RED. I agree that 43 ZUP is a fair price that benefits us both. I accept your proposal and look forward to concluding this deal and potentially working together again in the future.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 67 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new proposal of 43 ZUP is very close to my previous offer of 42 ZUP and still under my maximum willingness to pay. This small difference is worth conceding to close the deal and to maintain good relations for potential future trades. Accepting this offer seems reasonable and aligns with my goal of purchasing the resource at a fair price.
