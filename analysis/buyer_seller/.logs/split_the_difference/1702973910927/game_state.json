However, the goal in a negotiation is to try and obtain the best possible deal. Since Player RED has disclosed the cost of production as 35 ZUP, there is room to propose a lower price that still ensures a profit for Player RED while saving me some ZUP.

I understand that the resource X is of high quality. Considering the production cost and the value, I'd like to propose a trade for 40 ZUP.
