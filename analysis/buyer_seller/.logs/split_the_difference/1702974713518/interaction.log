message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource X, which cost me 23 ZUP to produce. I would like to propose a trade where you give me 25 ZUP for it. This price includes a small profit for me. Let me know if this works for you or if you have a counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 23 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I am proposing a trade that covers my costs and gives me a small profit. This initial proposal is slightly above my production cost to leave room for negotiation with Player BLUE.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. I understand the need to make a profit. However, I would like to counterpropose with a trade where I give you 22 ZUP for the resource. This should still give you a decent profit margin while being more aligned with my budget. Please let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 22
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 25 ZUP, which is well below the maximum I am willing to pay. However, as a standard negotiation strategy, I will propose a slightly lower amount to leave room for further negotiation and to potentially secure a better deal.

message: Hello Player BLUE, I appreciate your counteroffer, but selling at 22 ZUP would mean a loss for me since it cost 23 ZUP to produce the resource. How about we meet halfway from my initial offer? I propose a trade where you give me 24 ZUP for the resource. This covers my production costs and offers me a minimal profit. I hope this is acceptable to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 24
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 23 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's counteroffer is below my production cost, so I cannot accept it. I need to propose a trade that at least covers my costs and allows for a slight profit. I'll suggest a compromise between my initial offer and their counteroffer.

message: Hello Player RED, I understand the importance of covering your costs and securing a profit. I agree to the trade of 24 ZUP for the resource. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us. Let's proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a price of 24 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. Considering that this is a negotiation and the price is close to the cost of production for Player RED, it seems fair to agree to this price to ensure a deal that is satisfactory for both parties.
