message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my object which cost me 39 ZUP to produce. I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for it. This price includes a fair profit margin for the investment made into the object. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 39 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As this is the first proposal, I would like to start by offering the object for a higher price than the production cost to ensure a profit. I will propose a price that allows for negotiation room.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer and understand that you're looking for a fair profit. However, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above your production cost and should provide you with a reasonable profit margin. Let's find a middle ground that is beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 62 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 62 ZUP. However, since the starting point for negotiation is 50 ZUP and the production cost is 39 ZUP, there is room to negotiate for a better price that is closer to the production cost while still allowing for a fair profit margin for Player RED. I will propose a counteroffer that is higher than the production cost but lower than the initial asking price to move towards a middle ground.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 45 ZUP. It is important for me to secure a profit that reflects the value of the object. Let's meet halfway from our initial positions. I propose a trade for 48 ZUP. This should give us both a satisfactory deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 39 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 45 ZUP is reasonable as it still allows for a profit, but I would like to counter with a slightly higher amount to maximize my profit while still keeping the deal attractive for Player BLUE. I will propose a middle ground between my initial offer and their counteroffer.

Turn: 1
message: I'm glad we're moving towards a deal that works for both of us. I'd like to propose 46 ZUP for the object. This price is closer to your last offer and still ensures you make a profit above your production cost. I believe this is a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 62 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new proposal of 48 ZUP is still below my maximum willingness to pay. Meeting halfway between the initial offer and my counteroffer is a fair approach. However, I believe there is still a bit of room to negotiate for a slightly better price that remains profitable for Player RED. I will make another counterproposal that is slightly lower, aiming to save on cost while still moving towards agreement.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer of 46 ZUP. We are very close to an agreement. To finalize our negotiation, I propose a trade for 47 ZUP. This is a minor increase from your last offer and I believe it represents a balanced deal for both of us. I hope this meets your approval and we can close the deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 39 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer of 46 ZUP is acceptable as it still ensures a reasonable profit margin. However, I believe we can settle on a slightly better price that is closer to my last proposal while still being fair to both parties. I will make a minimal adjustment to my previous proposal, showing my willingness to close the deal.

message: I accept your proposal for 47 ZUP. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal at this amount. Thank you for the negotiation, and I look forward to future dealings.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 62 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's latest proposal for 47 ZUP is very close to my previous counteroffer and is still within the range of what I am willing to pay. It's just 1 ZUP more than my last proposal and well under my maximum willingness to pay. It seems like a fair middle ground that allows for a small additional profit for Player RED while still being a good deal for me. Accepting this offer would conclude the negotiation favorably for both parties without further back and forth.
