message: I am offering the object X, which cost me 30 ZUP to produce. I believe 40 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiation, considering the quality and value of the object. Let's work out a deal that is beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 30 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: I am proposing a starting trade that covers my costs and adds a margin for profit. The initial proposal is a bit higher than my production cost to leave room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the cost of production and the value you've placed on the object. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I'd like to propose a price of 35 ZUP to start with. I believe this is still a fair offer that allows for a reasonable profit margin for you, and it's closer to my intended budget for such a resource. Let's continue to negotiate to find an agreement that suits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 75 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price of 40 ZUP is within my acceptable range, but it's in my interest to negotiate a lower price to conserve resources for future transactions. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if the seller is willing to consider it.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer and understand your budget concerns. However, to meet halfway and ensure a fair deal for both parties, I propose a price of 37 ZUP. This price still gives me a modest profit while also respecting the value you're seeking. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 30 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my initial asking price but still above my production cost, which leaves room for profit. However, I would like to negotiate a slightly higher price to increase the profit margin. I'll propose a price that splits the difference between the initial offer and the counteroffer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I agree that 37 ZUP is a fair compromise for both of us. It gives you a deserved profit while staying within my budget. I'm happy to proceed with this deal and accept your offer of 37 ZUP for the object X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 75 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has offered a compromise at 37 ZUP, which is closer to my ideal payment range. Since this price is still well below my maximum willingness to pay and it seems like a fair middle ground, accepting this offer would be beneficial for both parties without further negotiation.
