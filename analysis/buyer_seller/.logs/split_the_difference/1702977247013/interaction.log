message: I am looking to sell my object X. Considering the production costs and the value of the resource, my initial proposal is for 40 ZUP. Let's negotiate a fair price that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 35 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As I am Player RED, my goal is to sell my object X for ZUP that at least covers my production cost of 35 ZUP. My first proposal will be slightly above my production cost to leave room for negotiation and to make a profit.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the initial offer. To move things forward, I propose 35 ZUP for X. This price accounts for both the value of the resource and ensures a competitive transaction for us both. Let's work together to find an agreement that's beneficial for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 64 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 40 ZUP for X, which is within the range of what I am willing to pay. However, as this is the beginning of the negotiation, it's standard practice to propose a counteroffer to see if there's room to agree on a lower price that still respects the value of the resource and the seller's costs.

message: Thank you for your proposal. I understand the need for a competitive transaction, but I also need to consider a small profit for my investment. How about we meet in the middle at 38 ZUP for the object X? This would cover my costs and give me a modest return, making it a fair deal for us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 35 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's proposal of 35 ZUP matches my production cost, so I would not be making any profit. I want to propose a counteroffer that is lower than my initial ask but still allows me to gain some profit. This should also show willingness to negotiate and come to a beneficial agreement for both parties.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand the importance of ensuring a profit on your end. I believe we're close to finding common ground. A counter proposal of 36 ZUP for X strikes a balance between your need for profit and my budget considerations. I think this could be a good compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 64 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer is still within my willing-to-pay range, but it's good negotiation practice to try and secure an even more favorable deal if possible, without risking the deal by pushing too hard. Proposing a slightly lower price than the counteroffer may lead to a compromise that is closer to my target price.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your understanding and willingness to ensure a fair deal. I accept your offer of 36 ZUP for the object X. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that allows for a small profit on my side while respecting your budget. Looking forward to finalizing our transaction.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 35 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered 36 ZUP, which is just above my production cost, thus providing a small profit. Considering that we have a limited number of proposals, and the offer is close to my previous counteroffer, I should consider accepting this proposal to ensure a sale and avoid a potential stalemate or decline in the offer.
