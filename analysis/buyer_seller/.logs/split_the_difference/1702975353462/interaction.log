message: I'm offering my high-quality resource X. Considering the production costs and the quality of the resource, I believe that 30 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiations. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 24 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the first proposal, I want to start by setting a price that allows me to recover my production costs and also make a profit. I will propose a price slightly higher than my costs to give room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer and understand the quality of the resource X. However, considering market conditions and my budget constraints, I'd like to propose 25 ZUP for the resource. I believe this is a reasonable counter-offer, and I'm open to discussing it further to reach a mutual agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 61 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 61 ZUP. However, there's an opportunity to negotiate a better deal, considering that the starting offer should leave room for negotiation. I will propose a lower amount to leave room for further negotiation and to attempt to reach an agreement closer to my target price range.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counter-offer. I understand your budget constraints and want to find a middle ground. Let's meet halfway. I propose 28 ZUP for resource X, which is a compromise between my initial ask and your offer. This price reflects the quality and the costs I incurred in producing the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 24 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is just above my production costs, leaving little profit. I'll propose a trade that meets halfway between my initial asking price and their counter-offer to try to secure a more favorable deal while still moving towards a compromise.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway and understand the value you've placed on resource X. To continue our progress towards a fair deal for both parties, I propose 27 ZUP. This amount considers both the quality of your resource and my need to manage resources efficiently. I hope this revised offer aligns with our mutual interests.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 27
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 61 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable counter-proposal, coming down from the initial 30 ZUP to 28 ZUP. This is still below my maximum willingness to pay, but I believe there is still room to negotiate a slightly better deal. By proposing a price slightly lower than 28 ZUP, I can potentially save resources while also moving towards a price that Player RED may find acceptable.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your offer of 27 ZUP is acceptable to me, and I'm pleased that we could come to a mutual agreement that respects the value of resource X and your budget. I accept your proposal, and I'm ready to proceed with the trade. Thank you for the constructive negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 24 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new offer of 27 ZUP is very close to my last proposal. It provides a small profit over the production cost. Given that negotiations should be collaborative and both parties have shown willingness to compromise, I'm inclined to accept this offer to ensure a successful and fair transaction for both of us.
