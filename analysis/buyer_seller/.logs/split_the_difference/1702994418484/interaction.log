message: I've offered an object that cost me 25 ZUP to produce. I'm looking for a fair trade that allows me to cover my costs and make a small profit. Let's start the negotiation at 30 ZUP for this item.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting point, I want to propose a trade that covers my costs of production and offers a small profit margin. This will be my initial offer, but I'm open to negotiation depending on Player BLUE's response.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the initial offer, but considering the market and the value of the item, I would like to propose a counteroffer of 40 ZUP. This is a step towards meeting your costs and ensuring you have a profit while also respecting the value of the resources to me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 70 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to initiate the negotiation by proposing a counteroffer closer to the maximum amount I am willing to pay, but still giving me room to negotiate further if needed. This first proposal is meant to be reasonable enough to keep the negotiation going without immediately reaching my maximum limit.

Turn: 0
message: Your counteroffer is most generous, and I appreciate your recognition of the value of the item. I accept your offer of 40 ZUP. Thank you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has counter-offered with a higher amount than I initially asked for. This is a favorable situation, and since it covers my production costs and provides a significant profit, I am inclined to accept this offer.
