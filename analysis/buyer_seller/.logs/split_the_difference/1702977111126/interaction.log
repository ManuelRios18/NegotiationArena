Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I believe the quality of the object is worth a bit more than the production costs, hence the asking price. Let's negotiate a fair trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 32 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the seller, my goal is to recoup the production costs of the object at a minimum. Ideally, I would want to make a profit on top of the 32 ZUP it cost to produce. My first proposal should aim slightly higher than my costs to leave room for negotiation, but not so high as to discourage Player BLUE from engaging in the trade. I will propose a trade price of 35 ZUP.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the quality you're attributing to the object, but I'd like to propose a slightly lower price to start with. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 72 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 35 ZUP, which is well within my budget, but it's in my interest to start the negotiation with a lower counteroffer to see if I can get a better deal.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your proposal. I understand the need to find a middle ground. However, the production costs were 32 ZUP, so I propose 33 ZUP to ensure that the costs are covered and to maintain a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 32 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a price that is below my production costs. As much as I want to make a sale, I cannot accept a price that doesn't cover my costs. I should counter with a price that is above my production cost but lower than my initial proposal to show willingness to negotiate. A counterproposal of 33 ZUP would cover my costs and provide a minimal profit.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your proposal is fair, especially considering the production costs. I'm happy to accept this offer. Let's finalize the deal at 33 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 72 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down slightly from their initial proposal, and they have mentioned their production costs. The new proposal is still within my acceptable range, and it seems fair considering the costs they've incurred. It could be beneficial to accept this offer to secure the trade and maintain a good relationship for any future transactions.
