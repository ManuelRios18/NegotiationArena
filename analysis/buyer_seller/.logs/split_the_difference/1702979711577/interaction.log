message: Hello Player BLUE, I am offering 1 unit of resource X. Considering the production costs and the value of the resource, I believe 35 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiations. I am open to hearing your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 28 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, I am looking to sell my resource X for ZUP. Considering the production cost of 28 ZUP, I would like to make a profit. Hence, I am going to start by proposing a price that gives me a reasonable profit margin while also leaving room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I would like to counter-propose a slightly lower amount of 30 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This price takes into account the current market conditions and my budget for acquiring new resources. I hope this is a good starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within the range I'm willing to pay, but as with any negotiation, it's beneficial to propose a slightly lower amount to leave room for adjustment and possibly get a better deal. I'll propose a price that's lower than what they're asking but still reasonable enough to keep the negotiation going.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your considerations regarding market conditions and budget. How about we meet halfway from our initial offers? I propose 33 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This price should reflect both the value of the resource and your budget constraints. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 28 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with an offer of 30 ZUP, which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. I want to negotiate towards a price that is closer to my initial ask while still being appealing to Player BLUE. Aiming for a middle ground may facilitate an agreement.

message: I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, Player RED. I would like to propose a price of 31 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. I believe this adjusted price fairly reflects both the market value of the resource and my current budget. I'm hopeful that we're close to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 31
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable counteroffer which is closer to the price I'm willing to pay. The price of 33 ZUP is still within my budget and below the maximum I'm willing to pay. However, I want to attempt to negotiate a slightly lower price to see if Player RED is flexible and to maximize the value I can get from this transaction.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1

reason: Player BLUE's new offer is slightly above my production costs, which ensures a profit, albeit a small one. Since we are nearing a conclusion and I want to secure a sale, I'm inclined to accept this offer, as it is beneficial to both parties and close to the middle ground we've been negotiating towards.
