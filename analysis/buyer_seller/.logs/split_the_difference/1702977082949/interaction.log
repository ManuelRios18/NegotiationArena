message: I'm offering one unit of resource X, which has high quality and is in perfect condition. Considering the production cost and the value it offers, I believe 30 ZUP is a fair price. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 26 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell the object for more than 26 ZUP to make a profit. I will start by proposing a trade slightly above my cost to see if Player BLUE is willing to pay a premium, but not so high as to seem unreasonable.

Turn: 1
message: Your offer seems fair and the quality of the resource X justifies the price. I am willing to accept the trade for 30 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 76 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The price proposed by Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 76 ZUP. Accepting this trade would be beneficial for me since it falls well within my budget. However, it could be possible to negotiate an even better deal that is closer to the lower end of my price range without reaching my maximum threshold.
