message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object which cost me 38 ZUP to produce. I'm proposing to sell it to you for 45 ZUP, which I believe is a fair price considering the production costs and the quality of the object. Let me know if this is acceptable or if you'd like to make a counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 38 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the first proposal, I want to start by setting a price that gives me a profit margin while also leaving room for negotiation. I will propose a price slightly above my production cost to see how Player BLUE values the object.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the offer and understand your production costs. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of 40 ZUP for the object. This is slightly above your production cost and should still give you a reasonable profit. Please let me know if this is acceptable or if you would like to negotiate further.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 68 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 68 ZUP. However, it is good practice to negotiate to try and get a better deal. I will make a counteroffer that is closer to the production cost but still offers a profit to Player RED.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your position and would like to meet you halfway. How about we settle at 42 ZUP for the object? This gives me a small but fair profit while also respecting the value of the object. I hope this is a compromise that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 38 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 40 ZUP, which is just above my production costs. While this does give me a profit, I want to negotiate for a slightly higher price to maximize my return. I'll propose a price in the middle of our initial offers to find a compromise that might be acceptable to both of us.

message: Thank you for the compromise, Player RED. I accept your offer of 42 ZUP for the object. It's a fair price and I look forward to finalizing our trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 68 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable counteroffer that is still within my maximum willingness to pay. The price is fair, and it's just 2 ZUP above my initial counteroffer, which means it is a good deal for me without protracting the negotiation unnecessarily. Accepting this offer would conclude the game positively and quickly.
