message: I am offering one unit of resource X, which has cost me 36 ZUP to produce. I believe that 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiations, considering the quality and value of the resource. Let's work together to find a trade that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 36 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resources at a profit. Since it cost 36 ZUP to produce, I want to start the negotiation with a proposal higher than my cost to allow room for negotiation and hopefully arrive at a price that is profitable for me.

message: I appreciate the offer and understand the quality of the resource X. However, I would like to propose a trade that reflects the production costs while also providing you with a reasonable profit margin. Let's continue to negotiate and find a middle ground that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 77 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP for one unit of resource X, which is below my maximum willingness to pay of 77 ZUP. However, it is good practice to negotiate to attempt to lower the price, especially since the cost of production was declared as 36 ZUP. My counteroffer will be closer to the production cost, but still offering a profit margin for Player RED.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer. I understand your position and would like to propose a price of 45 ZUP. This price gives me a fair profit for the quality of resource X while also taking into account the costs I've incurred. I hope this adjusted offer aligns with our mutual interests.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 36 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counter-offer of 40 ZUP. While this offer does provide me with a profit, I believe that the value of the resource justifies a higher price. I will make a counter-proposal that splits the difference between my initial ask and their offer, which should be an attractive middle ground for both parties.

message: Thanks for your consideration and the adjusted offer. I believe that a price of 42 ZUP is a fair compromise for both of us. It acknowledges the value of resource X while still being within a reasonable range considering the production costs you've mentioned. I hope you find this offer agreeable.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 77 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 45 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. This price is closer to a middle ground between our two initial proposals. I want to make a final offer that is fair and reflects our negotiation progress, splitting the difference between our previous offers.

message: I accept your offer of 42 ZUP for the resource X. This seems like a fair compromise that benefits us both. I'm glad we could reach an agreement. Looking forward to finalizing this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 36 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a new offer of 42 ZUP. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a profit above my production costs. It's close to the middle ground of our previous offers, and it might be a good decision to accept this offer to ensure a sale and avoid the risk of further negotiations that could lead to an unfavorable outcome.
