message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but I would like to propose a middle ground. How about we settle at 38 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This should give us both a fair deal considering the production costs and potential market value.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 34 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is just above my production cost. I would like to aim for a higher profit margin while still making the trade appealing to the buyer. Therefore, I will propose a price between my initial ask and their counteroffer.

message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. I think we're getting closer to an agreement. My new proposal is 36 ZUP for 1 unit of X. I believe this is a competitive offer that takes into account both the production costs and the value of the resource.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 64 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down slightly from their initial asking price, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I believe there is still room for negotiation to reach a more favorable price point. I will propose a slightly higher amount than my initial offer, but still below the current proposal from Player RED.
