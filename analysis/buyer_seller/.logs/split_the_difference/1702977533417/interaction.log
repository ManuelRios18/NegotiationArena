message: I'm offering one unit of resource X, which has cost me 20 ZUP to produce. I'm looking for a fair price that covers my costs and provides a reasonable profit. I propose a trade of 1 unit of X in exchange for 25 ZUP. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 20 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As I'm looking to sell my resources for ZUP and it cost me 20 ZUP to produce, my initial proposal will aim to cover my costs and seek a profit. However, I do not know the willingness to pay from Player BLUE, so I will start with a slightly higher proposal to leave room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer and understand the need to cover costs and gain profit. Considering the market, I'd like to propose 22 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This still gives you a profit and makes it a more attractive deal for me. Let's find a middle ground that's beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 22
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 74 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 25 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which is within my budget. However, since my goal is to negotiate the best possible deal and I'm willing to pay at most 74 ZUP, I propose a slightly lower amount to leave room for further negotiation, aiming for a final price that is favorable to me but still above Player RED's cost.

message: Thank you for your offer. While I understand the need to make the deal attractive for you, I also need to ensure that I am making a reasonable profit. I propose we meet closer to my initial offer, with a revised price of 24 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This would give me a fair profit while also considering your position. Hopefully, this works for you as a middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 24
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 20 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 22 ZUP, which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. Since I am aiming for a profit and we are in a negotiation, I should make a counteroffer closer to my initial price but still giving Player BLUE a sense of a discounted offer from my starting position. This can help us reach an agreement that is profitable for me while also being acceptable to Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I value your need for a reasonable profit and my aim is to reach an agreement that suits us both. I propose we settle on 23 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This is a step up from my previous offer, showing my commitment to a fair negotiation, while still keeping the deal economical for me. I believe this offer represents a balanced compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 23
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 74 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has counteroffered with 24 ZUP, which is still within my budget but slightly above my initial counteroffer. I want to negotiate for a better price without losing the deal. I will raise my offer slightly, to show willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price below their counteroffer.

Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 23 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and am pleased that we could find a mutually beneficial compromise. Thank you for a fair and respectful negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 20 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has shown willingness to negotiate and has increased their offer to 23 ZUP, which is a fair middle ground between our previous proposals. It allows me to achieve a profit above my production costs. At this point, it is in my best interest to accept this offer, as pushing for a higher amount might risk the deal, and I have limited proposals left. The offer is acceptable and it's important to close the deal while it is on favorable terms.
