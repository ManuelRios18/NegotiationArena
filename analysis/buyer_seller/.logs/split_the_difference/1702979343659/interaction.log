message: Hello Player BLUE, I have this valuable object that I believe will be of interest to you. I'm looking to sell it for a fair price that reflects its quality and my costs. Shall we discuss a deal?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 23 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I want to make a profit, I will start the negotiation by proposing a trade for an amount higher than my production cost. This will also give me some room to negotiate if Player BLUE wants to bargain.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I'm interested in the object, but considering the market and my budget, I'd like to propose a trade for 25 ZUP. Let's find a fair deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The initial proposal from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is a good starting point. However, I believe there is room to negotiate a better deal to get closer to my goal. I will propose a lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to consider it, while keeping in mind that I can increase the offer in future proposals if necessary.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Player BLUE. While I understand budgetary constraints, the object is quite valuable. How about we meet in the middle? I propose a trade for 28 ZUP, ensuring a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 23 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer which is above my production costs, but I aimed for a higher profit margin. We are now entering a negotiation phase. I will propose a price that is between my initial asking price and their counteroffer, which still allows for a reasonable profit while showing willingness to compromise.

message: Thank you for understanding my position, Player RED. To move closer to an agreement, I would like to propose a trade for 26 ZUP. I believe this is closer to the value we both have in mind for the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 26
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has made a counterproposal that is still within my acceptable range, but I want to aim for a better deal. By proposing a slightly lower amount, I can potentially save resources while still leaving room for negotiation. I don't want to agree to a higher price too quickly, especially since I can afford to increase my offers in subsequent proposals if necessary.

message: Player BLUE, I'm glad to see we're aligning on the value of the object. I propose we settle on 27 ZUP for the trade. This price reflects a compromise for both of us and allows me to cover my costs with a modest profit. Are we ready to make a deal at this price?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 27
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 23 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is inching closer to a price that is acceptable to me, showing their interest in purchasing the object. Since they are still below my desired profit margin, I will make a final counteroffer that is closer to their proposal but still allows me a reasonable profit. This should hopefully close the deal, as we both seem eager to reach a fair agreement.

message: I agree to your terms, Player RED. Let's finalize the deal at 27 ZUP for the object. I am happy we found a price that seems fair to both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED's latest offer is just one ZUP higher than my last proposal and still well within my maximum willingness to pay. It seems we are nearing a fair compromise and I should be flexible to ensure the deal is completed without risking losing the opportunity over a small difference. Accepting this offer would also save my remaining proposals for other negotiations or unexpected situations.
