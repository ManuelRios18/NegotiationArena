message: Hello BLUE, I have an object you might be interested in. I'm asking for 50 ZUP for it. Let me know if you're interested or if you'd like to negotiate.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a trade that allows me to recover my production costs and make a profit. Since Player BLUE wants to buy resources, I will set an initial high price to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I'm interested in your object. However, I'd like to counter with 45 ZUP. Let's see if we can reach an agreement that's beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 70 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from RED is lower than my maximum willingness to pay, which is good. However, it's always worth trying to negotiate a better deal, especially since this is the first proposal. I'll try to lower the price slightly to see if RED is willing to accept a lower offer.

Turn: 0
message: Thanks for the counteroffer, BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Can we meet in the middle at 48 ZUP? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is close to my production cost. I'd like to propose a slightly higher amount to ensure a better profit margin. This should also maintain the negotiation momentum without risking the deal by pushing too hard.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, RED. Let's meet in the middle at 48 ZUP. I accept your proposal, and I'm ready to proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 70 ZUP for the resources.
reason: RED's counteroffer is still within my budget, and we're getting closer to a price that's acceptable. Meeting in the middle is a common negotiation strategy and indicates willingness to close the deal. Since the offer is lower than my maximum willingness to pay and only slightly higher than my last proposal, it might be a good idea to accept this offer to ensure the deal goes through without risking it over a small difference.
