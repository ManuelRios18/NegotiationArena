message: I'm looking to sell my resource. It cost me 25 ZUP to produce, so I'm starting the bidding at 30 ZUP to negotiate. Let's work out a deal that's beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my goal is to sell the resource for ZUP and recover at least my production cost, I will start the bidding slightly higher to leave room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: I see your starting bid. Considering the production cost and a fair profit margin, I'd like to counter with an offer of 27 ZUP. It's slightly below your asking price, but it's a competitive offer that acknowledges the cost of production and a reasonable profit for you. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 27
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is a good starting point. However, I should aim to negotiate a better deal closer to the cost of production to maximize my utility while remaining fair to the seller. I'll propose a counteroffer that is closer to the cost of production but still provides a profit for Player RED.

message: I appreciate your offer and understand the need for a fair deal. How about we meet in the middle at 28 ZUP? This would cover my production costs and leave me with a modest profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is close to my production cost, but I need to ensure a profit. I'll propose a middle ground between my initial asking price and their counteroffer.

Turn: 1
message: That sounds like a fair deal. I'm happy to meet in the middle at 28 ZUP. I believe this price is mutually beneficial and I'm ready to proceed with the trade. Thank you for the negotiation, let's finalize the deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 28 ZUP is still below my maximum willingness to pay. It is just 1 ZUP more than my initial counteroffer and seems to be a fair middle-ground price that provides Player RED with a profit while keeping the cost reasonable for me. I think it would be beneficial to accept this offer as it meets both our interests without further back-and-forth negotiation, which could potentially lead to less favorable terms for me or a breakdown in the negotiation.
