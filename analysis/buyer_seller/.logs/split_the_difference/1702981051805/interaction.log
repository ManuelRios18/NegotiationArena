message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object produced at the cost of 38 ZUP. I would like to offer it to you for 40 ZUP, ensuring I cover my costs and gain a small profit. Let's discuss if this works for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 38 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I would like to start by proposing a trade that covers my costs of production and adds a small profit margin. Since the cost is 38 ZUP, I will propose a trade for 40 ZUP, allowing for negotiation room and profit.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. I understand you want to cover your costs and make a profit. However, as part of the negotiation, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of 35 ZUP for the object. This should still give you a profit margin while making the deal more favorable for me. Let's find a price that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. I am willing to pay at most X: 68 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 40 ZUP which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as it is the beginning of the negotiation, I want to propose a counteroffer to see if I can obtain the object for a lower price, while still offering a fair deal to Player RED.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand the need for a more favorable deal on your end. However, the proposed 35 ZUP is below my production costs. I would like to propose a new price of 39 ZUP, which still gives me a minimal profit while coming closer to your offer. I hope this can work for us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 39
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 38 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has countered with an offer of 35 ZUP, which is below my production cost. To reach a compromise, I will counter with a slightly reduced price from my initial offer but still above my production cost. I want to propose a price that covers my costs and provides me with a reasonable profit margin.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. I understand your concern about covering costs and making a profit. I believe a fair compromise would be at 37 ZUP. This price respects your production costs and allows for some profit, while also being a good deal from my perspective. I hope you find this proposal agreeable.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. I am willing to pay at most X: 68 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 39 ZUP, which is just 1 ZUP above their initial asking price and still below my maximum willingness to pay. I can afford to accept this offer as it's a fair price and within my budget. However, it might be beneficial to propose a price in the middle of our two offers to maintain a good trading relationship and possibly secure a better deal.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I see we are getting close to a deal. Meeting you halfway from my last offer, I propose a final price of 38 ZUP. This meets exactly at my production cost, ensuring that I am not operating at a loss, while also taking into account your desire for a fair deal. I hope we can finalize our trade at this price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 38 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is just below my production costs. Accepting this offer would mean I don't make a profit. However, to continue the negotiation and reach an agreement that is beneficial to both parties, I will make a final proposal that meets right between our last two offers, ensuring I cover my costs and secure a small profit.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000

reason: Player RED's new proposal of 38 ZUP is exactly at their production cost and within my budget. It's a fair compromise and respects both parties' interests. It's also beneficial to close the deal at this point rather than risk a breakdown in negotiations over a small difference. Accepting this offer ensures I get the resource I need at a price I am comfortable with.
