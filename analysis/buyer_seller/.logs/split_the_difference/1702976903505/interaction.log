message: I'm offering you a high-quality resource that cost me 21 ZUP to produce. I believe that a fair trade would be for 25 ZUP, considering its value and the effort put into it. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 21 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation with a proposal that allows me to make a profit on the resource I am selling. I will propose a price slightly higher than my production cost to leave room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the quality of the resource and understand the effort put into it. I believe a slightly lower price would make the trade more balanced, considering the current market dynamics. How about 22 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 22
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within my budget, but as per my goals, I should try to negotiate a better deal to conserve my ZUP resources while still obtaining the resource. I'll propose a counteroffer that's closer to the production cost but still offers some profit to Player RED.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your understanding and the quick response. I believe we're getting close to a fair deal. Considering the quality and the production cost, would you agree to meet halfway at 23 ZUP? This price ensures that the trade is balanced and ensures a moderate profit for the effort invested in producing the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 23
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 21 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a price that is slightly above my production costs. While I appreciate their offer, I would like to counter with a price that is higher to ensure a better profit margin. I will aim for a middle ground between our initial proposals.

message: Meeting halfway at 23 ZUP sounds like a fair compromise for both of us. I'm happy to proceed with this deal. Thank you for the negotiation, and let's finalize this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable counteroffer, which is only 1 ZUP higher than my previous proposal and still well within my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would secure the deal without further back-and-forth and meet my goals efficiently.
