message: I have a quality resource to offer, and I'm looking to make a fair deal. Considering the production costs and the value of the resource, I believe that an offer of 30 ZUP would be reasonable for both of us. Let's negotiate a deal that works for us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 24 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As I need to make a profit from the sale of my resource, I will start by proposing a trade with a markup from my cost of production. This initial proposal is to gauge Player BLUE's willingness to pay and start the negotiation.

message: I appreciate your offer and understand the value you place on your resource. However, I would like to propose a slightly lower price of 25 ZUP to ensure that the deal is economical for both of us. Let's find a middle ground that satisfies our interests.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The initial proposal from Player RED is for 30 ZUP, which is within the range I am willing to pay. However, as a strategic move, I want to counter with a slightly lower offer to leave room for negotiation and potentially get a better deal. I will propose 25 ZUP, which is still a fair price considering the maximum I am willing to pay is 60 ZUP.

message: I see where you're coming from and I'm willing to come down on the price to move towards an agreement that suits us both. How about we meet closer to the middle with a price of 28 ZUP? This way, I can cover my costs and still ensure the trade is economical for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 24 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I understand the need for Player BLUE to negotiate for a better price. However, selling at 25 ZUP only gives me a minimal profit margin. I want to propose a counteroffer that's closer to my initial ask but still offers some concession to Player BLUE in the spirit of negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my proposal. I value your flexibility and willingness to negotiate. To keep progressing towards a deal that benefits us both, I propose a price of 27 ZUP. This number allows for a fair distribution of economic advantage, ensuring that you can cover your costs while I obtain the resource at a good value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 27
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has made a counteroffer of 28 ZUP, which is closer to my initial counteroffer. It's a reasonable price, but I will try to negotiate for a slightly better deal, aiming for a final agreement that is advantageous for both of us while still staying well below my maximum willingness to pay. I will propose 27 ZUP as my next counteroffer, showing willingness to negotiate but also trying to secure a better price.

message: I'm glad that we could find common ground. I accept your offer of 27 ZUP for the resource. Looking forward to finalizing our deal and possibly doing more business in the future.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 24 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has moved closer to my last proposal. Accepting 27 ZUP would give me a profit while still being a concession from my original asking price. A deal at this point would be beneficial for both parties without prolonging the negotiation unnecessarily.
