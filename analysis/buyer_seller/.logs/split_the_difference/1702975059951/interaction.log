message: I am looking to sell my object X. It cost me 32 ZUP to produce. I believe that 50 ZUP is a fair price, considering the quality and value of X. Are you interested in this offer?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 32 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to propose an initial trade that covers my production costs and offers a profit margin. I'll start by setting a high price expecting negotiations which might bring the price down to a more reasonable level.

Turn: 1
message: I understand the value you've placed on your object X and your production costs. I think X is a valuable resource, but I'd like to propose a price of 40 ZUP, which is above your production cost and still provides you with a profit. Would this be acceptable for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 73 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is X: 73 ZUP. However, it is in my best interest to negotiate for a better price if possible, without disrespecting the cost that Player RED incurred to produce the object. A counteroffer closer to the production cost but still providing some profit to Player RED seems reasonable.

message: I appreciate your offer of 40 ZUP and understand the need for negotiation. Let's meet in the middle. How about 45 ZUP for my object X? This price reflects both the quality of X and gives us both a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 32 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is above my production cost, which is good, but I aimed for a higher profit margin. I will propose a compromise that is closer to my initial asking price but still gives Player BLUE a sense that their counteroffer was taken into consideration.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your proposal of 45 ZUP for object X sounds reasonable and fair. I'm happy to accept this offer and proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 73 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is a compromise between my previous offer and their initial price. This is still within my acceptable range and ensures a fair transaction for both parties. Accepting this offer will conclude the negotiation positively and efficiently.
