message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X for sale. Considering the production costs and the value of the object, I propose a trade where I give you X in exchange for 40 ZUP. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this does not suit you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 31 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a price slightly higher than my production cost to leave room for negotiation and ensure a profit.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. I'm interested in the object X, but I would like to propose a slightly adjusted trade where I give you 35 ZUP for the object. Let's work together to find an agreement that suits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 70 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is good. However, as in any negotiation, it's typical to counter with a slightly lower offer to arrive at a more favorable position through bargaining. Therefore, I will propose a slightly lower amount of ZUP to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand we both are looking for a fair deal, so how about we meet halfway between our initial proposals? I propose 38 ZUP for the object X. This should give us both a satisfactory outcome.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 31 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is close to my production cost. I would like to counter with a price that still allows me a profit but also comes closer to meeting in the middle.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, Player RED. I think we are close to a deal. Would you consider 37 ZUP for the object X? This small adjustment would make the deal perfect from my perspective. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 70 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counterproposal of 38 ZUP is still below my maximum willingness to pay. Meeting halfway is a common negotiation strategy that often leads to an agreement. Considering this is the second proposal and the offer is reasonable, it might be beneficial to accept this trade to ensure the acquisition of the object and avoid the risk of the negotiation deteriorating. However, I could potentially propose 37 ZUP to see if Player RED would accept that, maintaining the negotiation momentum while also getting a better deal for myself.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I accept your proposal of 37 ZUP for the object X. I believe this is a fair trade for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 31 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is above my production cost and close to my last proposal. Accepting this offer would ensure a profit, and further negotiation might risk the deal. It may be a good idea to accept this offer.
