message: Hello Player RED, I understand the value you've placed on your resource. However, I'd like to propose 40 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This is a starting point for our negotiation, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 78 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The starting proposal from Player RED is 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a strategic move, I'll propose a lower amount to leave room for negotiation and potentially reach an agreement that is more favorable to me.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet closer to my initial asking price? I propose 47 ZUP for 1 unit of X. I believe this is a fair price considering the quality and cost of production. I'm open to further discussion.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 34 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is above my production cost, but I initially asked for 50 ZUP to leave room for negotiation. I will counter with a slightly lower price than my initial ask but still above my production cost to keep the negotiation moving forward.

message: I appreciate your consideration, Player RED. While I see your point on the quality and production costs, I would like to propose a slight increase to 43 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Let's continue to work towards an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 78 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 47 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, to continue the negotiation and seek a more favorable outcome, I will make a slight increase in my previous offer to show willingness to move forward while still aiming to pay less than what RED has asked for.

message: It's great to see our negotiation progressing, Player RED. I propose we go to 44 ZUP for 1 unit of X as a fair midpoint that edges us closer to a deal that is good for both of us. I hope you'll find this offer to be reasonable.

reason: Player RED has come down to 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which is still under my maximum willingness to pay. However, as part of negotiation strategy and to inch closer to a deal, I'll propose a price that is midway between my last offer and RED's current offer, potentially leading to an agreement.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I believe 44 ZUP for 1 unit of X is a fair deal that reflects both the quality of the resource and our negotiation efforts. I accept your proposal, and I'm glad we could come to an agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 34 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come very close to my previous offer. Since this is my last proposal, I will accept this offer to ensure a sale and to avoid possibly ending the game without any sale at all. The proposed price gives me a reasonable profit margin above my production costs.
