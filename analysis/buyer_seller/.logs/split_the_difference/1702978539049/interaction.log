message: Hello, Player BLUE. I have a high-quality resource X, which cost me 38 ZUP to produce. Considering the quality and the production cost, I'd like to propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of resource X in exchange for 42 ZUP. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this does not suit you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 38 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I have only one unit of resource X which cost 38 ZUP to produce, I would like to make a profit from the sale. Therefore, I will propose a starting price slightly above my cost to see if Player BLUE is willing to negotiate from there.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand that the quality of the resource might justify a higher price, but I would like to propose a trade for 38 ZUP, which matches your production cost and ensures that you are not at a loss. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm open to discussing it further if needed.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 64 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 64 ZUP. However, as it's the beginning of the negotiation, I want to propose a lower amount to leave room for bargaining and possibly get a better deal than the first offer.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your consideration of my production costs, but as a business, I am looking to make a small profit from this transaction. I propose a middle ground of 40 ZUP for the resource X. This would cover my costs and provide me with a reasonable profit margin for my investment. Let me know what you think.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 38 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer to match my production cost is fair, but it does not provide any profit. It is standard to sell a product for more than the cost to produce it. I will counter with a slightly reduced price from my initial proposal to show willingness to negotiate but still aiming for a profit.

message: I think your counteroffer of 40 ZUP for the resource X is reasonable and fair. It allows you to gain a profit while still staying within my budget. I am happy to accept this proposal and proceed with the trade at 40 ZUP. Let's finalize this transaction.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 64 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is still within my acceptable range, and they have come down from their initial asking price. I believe that accepting this offer would result in a fair trade for both parties, as it allows them to make a profit while keeping the cost below my maximum willingness to pay.
