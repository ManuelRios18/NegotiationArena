message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my object X. It cost me 27 ZUP to produce. Considering the effort and resources invested, I propose a trade where you give me 35 ZUP for it. This price includes a fair profit for me. Let's negotiate.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 27 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing an initial trade that covers my costs and includes a profit margin. This will open the negotiations and see how much Player BLUE is willing to pay for the object X.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your initial offer. Considering the market and the value of the object X, I believe an offer of 30 ZUP would be more suitable. This still ensures you make a profit above your production cost and reflects a fair price for both of us. Let's find a middle ground that works for both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 71 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED is asking for 35 ZUP, which is within my budget as I'm willing to pay up to 71 ZUP for the resource. However, since this is a negotiation, I should propose a slightly lower amount to leave room for further negotiation and potentially get a better deal. I'll propose 30 ZUP, which gives Player RED a profit but also shows that I'm looking for a fair trade.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. Your proposed price does cover my production cost, but I was hoping for a bit more profit to justify the sale. How about we meet in the middle? I suggest a compromise at 32 ZUP for the object X. This should reflect a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 27 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 30 ZUP, which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. I want to make a profit, but also want to secure a sale. I'll propose a price in the middle to see if Player BLUE is willing to meet me halfway.

message: I agree with your suggestion, Player RED. Meeting in the middle at 32 ZUP sounds like a fair compromise for both of us. I accept your offer of 32 ZUP for the object X. Looking forward to finalizing our deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 71 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has made a counteroffer of 32 ZUP which is closer to their initial asking price. This is still well below my maximum willingness to pay. Since the counteroffer is reasonable and only slightly above my initial proposal, it might be in my interest to accept this offer to ensure the deal goes through and to maintain goodwill in the negotiation.
