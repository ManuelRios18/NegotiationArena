message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my object X, which has cost me 38 ZUP to produce. I believe a starting offer of 45 ZUP would give me a fair return on my investment while also leaving room for negotiation. I am open to hearing your counteroffer if this price does not suit you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 38 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As this is my first proposal, I want to start the negotiation by proposing a price that allows me some profit over the production cost, but I am also prepared to negotiate further if necessary.

message: Thank you for your offer. I understand your need for a fair return on your investment. I would like to counter with an offer of 40 ZUP for the object. This should still give you a profit while making the trade more appealing to me. Let's find a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 62 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is 45 ZUP, which is within my budget. However, as a negotiation strategy, I will try to lower the price to increase the value I get from the trade. I will propose a price that is closer to RED's cost but still gives them a profit, aiming for a better deal while remaining fair.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 40 ZUP, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To meet halfway, I propose a trade of 42 ZUP for my object X. This price should provide a reasonable return for me and a fair purchase price for you. I hope this offer aligns more closely with what you're willing to pay.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 38 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 40 ZUP, which is just above my production cost. While this does provide a profit, I believe we can agree on a slightly higher amount that would be beneficial for both of us. I will propose a midpoint that should be more appealing to Player BLUE while still improving my profit margin.

message: I'm pleased to see that we are moving in the right direction, Player RED. To continue our negotiation, I propose a trade of 41 ZUP for your object X. This is a slight increase from my original offer and should still offer you a decent profit margin. Hopefully, this trade is closer to your expectations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 62 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 42 ZUP, which is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but still above the initial offer I made. Since there is still room for negotiation within my budget, I will attempt to get a better price. I will propose a price slightly higher than my first offer, which should be more agreeable to Player RED while still securing a good deal for myself.

message: Thank you for your latest offer, Player BLUE. I agree to the trade of 41 ZUP for my object X. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us, providing me with a profit and you with the object you desire. Let's proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 38 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 41 ZUP. This is only slightly above my production costs, but given the back-and-forth nature of the negotiation, it may be close to the final value they are willing to pay. I will accept this offer to ensure a sale and avoid the risk of the deal falling through, resulting in a small but guaranteed profit.
