message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a sale of my object X for 25 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and includes a modest markup. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 22 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I am proposing a trade that allows me to recover the production cost of the object X and perhaps make a small profit. Since the production cost was 22 ZUP, I will start by proposing a slightly higher price to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I appreciate the fair starting point. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of 20 ZUP for the object X. This amount respects the value of the object while also reflecting my budget considerations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 61 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has offered to sell their object X for 25 ZUP, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay. However, it is good practice to negotiate for a better deal, especially since this is the starting point of the negotiation. I will propose a slightly lower amount to leave room for further negotiation if needed.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your budget considerations, but I must cover my production costs. Therefore, I propose a trade of 22 ZUP for object X, which is exactly what it cost me to produce it. I hope you find this proposal acceptable, as it respects both our positions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 22
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 22 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production cost, which is not acceptable. I need to at least cover my costs. I will counter with a price that is at my break-even point to show my willingness to negotiate, but I cannot go lower than my production cost.

message: Thank you for sharing your production cost, Player RED. I understand the importance of covering costs, and I believe your proposal is reasonable. I accept your offer of 22 ZUP for object X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 61 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a proposal of 22 ZUP. This is still below my maximum willingness to pay and is reasonable considering they claim it covers their production costs. I believe accepting this offer would be advantageous as it secures the resource at a good price without further back-and-forth negotiation that could risk the deal.
