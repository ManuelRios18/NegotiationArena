message: I've set the price for my object at 30 ZUP considering the production costs and the quality of the object. Let's negotiate a fair trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 24 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the opening proposal, I want to set a starting price that ensures I cover my production costs and also leaves room for negotiation. I'll propose a price slightly higher than my costs, anticipating that Player BLUE may want to negotiate for a lower price.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the quality of the object and your production costs. However, I would like to propose a slightly lower price of 25 ZUP to start our negotiations. I believe this is still a fair offer considering the market. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 68 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Since I am willing to pay up to 68 ZUP for the resources, the initial offer of 30 ZUP for the object is well within my budget. However, it is in my interest to get the best possible deal. I will make a counteroffer that is lower than the asking price but still within a range that I find acceptable and hope that it is also acceptable for Player RED.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. I understand your position, but I would need to make at least a small profit from our trade. How about we meet closer to the middle? I propose 28 ZUP for the object. This allows me to cover costs and ensures you're getting a quality product at a fair price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 24 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is 25 ZUP, which is just above my production costs. I want to make a profit, so I will counter with a price higher than 25 ZUP but lower than my initial proposal of 30 ZUP to move the negotiation forward.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand the importance of making a profit and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Your offer of 28 ZUP seems fair, and I'm happy to accept this deal to ensure quality and a good relationship for potential future trades.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 68 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The counteroffer of 28 ZUP is still below my maximum willingness to pay and represents a fair middle ground between my initial counteroffer and Player RED's original price. It is close enough to my proposed price that I am inclined to accept this offer. By accepting this trade, I would ensure a successful transaction and maintain goodwill for any future dealings.
