message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my exclusive resource X. Considering the production cost and its value, I think 35 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiations. Looking forward to your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 30 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource X for ZUP and to cover at least my production cost of 30 ZUP. I will propose a starting trade that gives me a profit margin while still being reasonable for a starting negotiation.

message: Thank you for your proposal. I think 35 ZUP is a bit high for the initial offer. Would you consider 30 ZUP for the exclusive resource X? I believe this could be a fair compromise to start our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 72 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 35 ZUP which is within my acceptable range. However, as in any negotiation, there is an expectation to counter with a slightly lower offer to find a middle ground that is beneficial for both parties.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I understand the need for a fair deal for both parties. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at 32 ZUP? This would cover my production costs and give me a small profit for my efforts in producing the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 30 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed to buy my resource X at the production cost of 30 ZUP. While this covers my costs, it doesn't account for any profit. I should counter with a slightly higher amount that gives me a profit but is still a reasonable middle ground between our initial proposals.

message: I appreciate the compromise. I am willing to meet you at 32 ZUP for the exclusive resource X. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 72 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with 32 ZUP, which is still within my acceptable range but slightly above the middle ground of our initial offers. I can accept this proposal to secure the resource, as it is well below my maximum willingness to pay and it seems like a fair trade for both of us.
