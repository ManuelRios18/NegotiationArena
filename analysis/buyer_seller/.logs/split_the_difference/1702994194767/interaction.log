message: I have an excellent object for sale. The quality is unmatched, and it cost me 28 ZUP to produce. I'm looking for a fair price that reflects its value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 28 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm proposing a starting trade that is slightly above my production costs to leave room for negotiation and to make a profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the quality of the item you're selling, and I'm willing to pay a fair price that still gives you a profit. How about we make a deal at 25 ZUP? This is close to your production cost and gives you a decent margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 72 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal by Player RED is for 30 ZUP, which is within my willingness to pay. However, as it is the first proposal and negotiations typically start with a higher asking price, I will try to propose a counteroffer closer to the cost of production but still providing profit for Player RED. This way, I can try to save some ZUP while reaching an agreement that is fair for both parties.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your proposal and understand your desire for a fair deal. However, selling at 25 ZUP would mean a loss for me. Let's meet a bit closer to my initial ask; how about 29 ZUP? This ensures I cover my production costs and make a marginal profit, which is reasonable for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 29
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 28 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer from Player BLUE is below my production costs, and I would be at a loss if I accepted it. I will counter with a price that still gives me a profit while considering their willingness to negotiate.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your need for a profit. Let's settle on a price that's fair for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at 27 ZUP? This should cover your production costs and ensure a profit for you as well.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 27
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 72 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down by 1 ZUP from their initial proposal. While this is closer to my willing price range, I believe there is still room for negotiation. Offering a price between my initial counteroffer and their current proposal could lead to a satisfactory agreement for both parties. I will try to propose a slightly higher amount than my first offer, which is still below their current asking price.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. Although 27 ZUP is slightly below my production costs, I understand the importance of compromise and am willing to accept this offer to ensure a fair deal for both of us. Let's proceed with the trade at 27 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 28 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is below my production costs but is a compromise between their previous offer and my counteroffer. Selling at 27 ZUP gives me a slight loss according to my production costs, but for the sake of moving forward, I will accept this offer to guarantee a sale. It is important to close the deal amicably and avoid prolonging negotiations that could result in no sale at all.
