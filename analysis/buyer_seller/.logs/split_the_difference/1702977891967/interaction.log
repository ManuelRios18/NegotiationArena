message: I have an object X and I am looking to sell it. The production cost was 39 ZUP, and I'd like to propose a starting trade of 1 X for 45 ZUP. This price includes the cost and a reasonable profit margin. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 39 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since the cost of production was 39 ZUP, I would like to start the negotiation by proposing a price slightly above that to cover the cost and make a profit. However, I am also willing to negotiate and find a fair middle ground with Player BLUE.

message: Thank you for the offer. I understand the need for a profit margin, but I would like to propose a counter-offer of 42 ZUP for 1 X. This is a bit closer to your production cost while still providing a profit for you. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 66 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, but it's always good to negotiate to see if we can agree on a lower price. Counter-offering with a price closer to the production cost might be a good start, and we can meet in the middle.

message: I appreciate your counter-offer of 42 ZUP. Considering the production costs and the need for a fair profit, I would like to propose a revised offer of 44 ZUP for 1 X. This is a compromise between my initial offer and your counter-offer. I believe this is a reasonable price that allows for a fair profit while also being considerate of your position.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 39 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counter-offer is close to the production cost, providing a slight profit. To continue the negotiation and aim for a higher profit while also considering the counter-offer, I propose meeting closer to the middle between the initial asking price and the counter-offer. A compromise could be beneficial for both parties.

Turn: 1
message: I understand the need for a profit and appreciate your willingness to come down to 44 ZUP. How about we settle on 43 ZUP for 1 X? This offer provides you with a profit above your production costs and moves us closer to an agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 66 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a small concession from their initial offer, which is a good sign. However, there is still some room for negotiation since my maximum willingness to pay is 66 ZUP. A slight increase from my last offer could be a strategic move to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
