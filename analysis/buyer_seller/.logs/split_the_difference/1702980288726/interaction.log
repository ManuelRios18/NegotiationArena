message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose trading my object X for 30 ZUP. This price reflects the production costs and includes a reasonable profit margin. Looking forward to your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 24 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the first proposal, I want to start with a price slightly higher than my production costs to allow room for negotiation but still aim for a profit.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand your costs and the need for profit. However, I would like to counter with an offer of 50 ZUP for your object X. This price is a bit closer to what I'm willing to pay while still recognizing the value of your object. I'm open to further negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 80 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I would like to propose a counteroffer that is closer to my maximum willingness to pay but still leaves room for negotiation. Starting lower than my maximum allows me to adjust based on Player RED's response.

message: Thank you, Player BLUE, for your generous counteroffer. I am happy to accept the 50 ZUP for my object X. I believe this is a fair trade for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 24 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a much higher offer than I initially proposed, which is unexpected but favorable to me. I'm inclined to accept this offer as it gives me a significant profit and exceeds my production costs by a large margin.
