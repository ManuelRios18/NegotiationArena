message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my object which cost me 22 ZUP to produce. I believe the quality and value of this object justify a selling price of 30 ZUP. Let's negotiate a fair price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 22 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to sell my object for more than it cost to produce to make a profit. I will start with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the offer and the effort that went into producing the object. However, I'd like to propose a price of 25 ZUP which I believe is a fair compromise considering the market conditions and the value of the object. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 69 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
I want to negotiate a better price closer to my maximum willingness to pay without revealing exactly what my limit is. The initial offer from Player RED is 30 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay, but I believe I can propose a lower price to save resources and potentially get a better deal.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I understand the need for a compromise. How about we meet halfway from our initial offers? I propose a price of 27 ZUP. This would give me a reasonable profit while still being a fair price for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 27
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 22 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 25 ZUP is above my production cost, which is good, but I would like to aim for a higher profit margin. I'll propose a price in the middle to see if we can agree on that.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. Meeting halfway is a fair approach. To finalize our deal, I propose a price of 26 ZUP. This small adjustment in the price would make the purchase more aligned with my budget while still ensuring you make a profit from your initial production cost. I believe we are very close to a fair deal for both sides.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 26
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 69 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED's counteroffer of 27 ZUP is closer to their initial ask and still below my maximum willingness to pay. I could accept this trade and still be well within my budget. However, I might attempt one more negotiation step to see if I can secure the object for a slightly lower price, which would be advantageous for me.

newly proposed trade: NONE
