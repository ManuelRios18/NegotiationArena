Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, considering the production costs and the quality of the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I would like to start with a proposal that covers my costs and includes a profit margin. However, I should not set the price too high as that may deter Player BLUE from accepting the trade.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I'd like to propose a slightly adjusted amount that I believe still reflects the value of the resource. Let's consider a trade at this new proposal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 71 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is lower than my maximum willingness to pay, which is good. However, to ensure a fair trade and possibly get a better deal, I will propose a slightly lower amount while leaving some room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer. Let's meet in the middle at 47 ZUP. This price reflects the value and production cost of the resource and allows for a fair profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is slightly above my production cost but below my initial asking price. This counteroffer is still within an acceptable range for me to make a profit. I will make a slight adjustment to find a middle ground that could be agreeable to both parties.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: The middle ground of 47 ZUP seems reasonable and fair. I am happy to accept this offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 71 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Meeting in the middle at 47 ZUP is a fair compromise, as it is still well below my maximum willingness to pay. By accepting this trade, I secure the resources at a favorable price without further back-and-forth, which is efficient and beneficial for both parties.
