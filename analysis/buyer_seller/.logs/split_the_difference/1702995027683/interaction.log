message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my object, which has cost me 25 ZUP to produce. I'd like to propose a starting trade where you would give me 30 ZUP for this object. This would cover my production cost and give me a small profit margin. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the starting point, I want to propose a trade that would allow me to recuperate the production cost of the resource, while also leaving room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I understand you want to cover your costs and make a profit, but I would like to counter with 25 ZUP for the object. This should cover your production costs and it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 75 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The opening offer from Player RED is 30 ZUP which is well below the maximum I'm willing to pay for the object. However, as it is the beginning of the negotiation, there is an opportunity to propose a lower amount to see if Player RED would be willing to accept that, potentially saving some of my resources.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. While I appreciate the offer to cover my production costs, I was hoping to make at least a small profit for the effort and risk involved in producing the object. How about we meet in the middle at 27 ZUP? This would give me a modest profit while still being fair to both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 27
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE covers my production costs, but I initially sought a small profit. However, I want to maintain good relations and show willingness to negotiate. I'll suggest a compromise that gives me a slight profit while still being reasonable for Player BLUE.

message: Meeting in the middle at 27 ZUP sounds like a fair deal to me, Player RED. I'm glad we could come to an agreement that benefits us both. I accept your offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 75 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has now come down to 27 ZUP, which is a compromise between the initial offers. This price is still well below my maximum willingness to pay. It is in my interest to close the deal at this price point, as it allows me to acquire the object for less than my maximum and saves room for future transactions.
