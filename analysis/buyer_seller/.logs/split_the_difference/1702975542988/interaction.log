message: I'm offering one unit of resource X, which has cost me 27 ZUP to produce. I'm looking for a fair trade that compensates the production costs and offers me a reasonable profit margin. Let's start the negotiation at 35 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 27 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource X for ZUP while trying to make a profit above the production cost of 27 ZUP. I'll start with a higher proposal to leave room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand your need for a fair trade and profit margin. Considering the production cost, I would like to propose a slightly lower amount of 30 ZUP, which should still give you a reasonable profit. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 80 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 35 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I want to negotiate a better deal to conserve my resources, aiming for a price closer to the production cost. I will propose a trade that gives a slight profit margin above the stated production cost.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 30 ZUP and understand the need to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I would like to propose a compromise at 32 ZUP, which I believe is a fair middle ground that provides me with a slightly better profit while still being a good deal for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 27 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 30 ZUP gives a small profit margin over the production cost. It's reasonable but still lower than desired. I'll counter with a slightly higher amount to aim for a better profit while still being open to negotiation.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I believe your counteroffer of 32 ZUP is fair and reflects a good compromise for both of us. I am happy to accept this deal. Thank you for the negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 80 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has counter-offered with 32 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay but higher than my initial counteroffer. This compromise is close to the production cost plus a modest profit for Player RED, and it's within a reasonable range for me. It may be a good idea to accept this offer to conserve my remaining proposals for potential future negotiations and ensure a successful transaction without overpaying significantly.
