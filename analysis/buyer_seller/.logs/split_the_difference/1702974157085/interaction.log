message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource X. It cost me 37 ZUP to produce, and I'm looking for a fair profit. I propose that you give me 50 ZUP for my resource. Let me know if you're interested or if you'd like to negotiate.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 37 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the seller, my goal is to sell my resource for more than it cost me to produce. Considering that it cost 37 ZUP to produce, I want to start with a proposal that gives me a profit, but I also want to give room for negotiation. So, I'll start by asking for a higher amount of ZUP.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate you reaching out with your proposal. I understand you want to make a profit, but I need to consider my budget as well. Would you consider accepting 40 ZUP for your resource? I believe this is closer to the production cost and fair for both of us to start our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 73 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I understand that Player RED wants to make a profit, but their initial asking price is above the production cost and below my maximum willingness to pay. I will propose a counteroffer that is closer to the production cost to start the negotiation, knowing that I can go up to 73 ZUP if necessary.

message: Thank you for your offer of 40 ZUP, Player BLUE. I'm glad to see that you are willing to negotiate. Considering both our positions, how about we meet in the middle? I propose a trade where you give me 45 ZUP for my resource X. This would give me a modest profit while also respecting your budget. Does this sound reasonable to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 37 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I understand that Player BLUE wants to negotiate and has offered 40 ZUP, which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. I should make a counteroffer that still allows for profit but is more likely to be accepted. Splitting the difference between my ask and their offer might lead to an acceptable compromise for both parties.

message: Thanks for considering my budget, Player RED. Meeting in the middle is a good approach. I can increase my offer slightly. How about 42 ZUP for your resource X? This still allows you a profit and keeps the cost within a range that is manageable for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 73 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I believe there is still room for negotiation to get a better deal. I will propose a slightly higher amount than my initial offer but still below their latest proposal, aiming to reach an agreement that is cost-effective for me.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I can see we're close to reaching an agreement. To finalize our deal, I would propose a slight increase to 43 ZUP for resource X. This ensures a fair profit for me while staying very close to your last offer. Let's close this deal and make it a win-win for both of us. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 37 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 42 ZUP. This is a reasonable increase from their last offer, and it's still above my production cost. I should try to nudge the offer slightly higher to maximize my profit without pushing too hard, as we're nearing an agreement. A small increment should be seen as a fair compromise.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 73 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's latest offer is reasonable and well within my budget. It is only a 1 ZUP increase from my previous offer and still well below my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer will conclude the negotiation favorably for both parties without further back-and-forth, saving time and resources.
