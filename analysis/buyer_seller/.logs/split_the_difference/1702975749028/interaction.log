message: I have a high-quality resource X available for sale. Considering the costs of production and the value it can bring to you, I propose a trade for 50 ZUP. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to negotiate further.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource (X) for more than it cost to produce, which was 40 ZUP. I will start by proposing a trade for 50 ZUP to see if Player BLUE is willing to pay a premium for the resource. This starting proposal is also a test to gauge Player BLUE's valuation of the resource.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer for the resource X. I believe we can come to a mutual agreement. Considering my budget and the value I place on the resource, I'd like to counter-propose with 40 ZUP. I think this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 75 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I'd like to negotiate a better deal since my total budget allows for up to 75 ZUP, but it's always good to start the negotiation at a lower price to leave room for adjustments and ensure a fair trade.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. Understanding the importance of this resource to you and keeping in mind my production costs, I'd like to propose a middle ground at 45 ZUP. This price allows me to cover my costs while offering you the resource at a fair value. Looking forward to finding a balance that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is at my breakeven point. Since my goal is to make a profit, I will counter with a slightly higher amount, aiming to meet in the middle. I'll propose 45 ZUP, which should be a reasonable markup for both sides, allowing me room for negotiation and profit.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I understand your position regarding production costs. I propose a slightly improved offer of 42 ZUP, which is closer to your last offer while still keeping the deal economical for me. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account both our interests.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 75 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 45 ZUP which is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. However, I still want to negotiate for a slightly better deal to conserve resources while also moving towards a fair compromise.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your revised offer and your efforts to reach a fair compromise. I accept your proposal of 42 ZUP for resource X. I'm looking forward to finalizing our deal and hope it will be the start of a mutually beneficial partnership.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 42 ZUP, which is above my production cost and offers a slight profit. To maintain good relations and secure a deal, I'm inclined to accept this offer. It's close to my previous counterproposal and allows for a successful transaction that meets my goal of selling above cost.
