message: I have a high-quality resource available for you. Considering the production costs and the value it offers, I believe 25 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 22 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As this is the first proposal, I will start by offering the resource slightly above my production cost to see if Player BLUE is willing to pay a premium for it. The initial markup will also give room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer and understand the value of high-quality resources. However, I would like to propose a counter-offer of 35 ZUP. I believe this reflects a fair middle ground given the quality of the resource and my budget constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to propose a counter-offer that is closer to my maximum willingness to pay but still gives me room for further negotiation if needed. The starting offer from Player RED is below my maximum threshold, which is good, but I would like to get the best possible deal. I'm proposing a trade at 35 ZUP, which is a reasonable increase from the initial offer but still below my maximum willingness to pay. This should signal my interest in the resource while also showing that I value it.

message: I'm pleased to see your understanding of the quality and value of the resource. I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to 38 ZUP, which I think still represents excellent value for you and a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 22 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a price that is above my initial asking price, which is excellent. I am inclined to accept this offer as it covers my production costs and provides a substantial profit. However, since this is a negotiation game, I will attempt to see if there is room for a slight increase while still keeping the offer attractive for Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your adjustment to 38 ZUP seems fair, and I agree that it represents excellent value for the quality of the resource being offered. I'm happy to accept this proposal and proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal from Player RED is very close to my previous offer and is still below my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would allow me to secure the resource without further negotiation and at a price that is within my acceptable range. Since the increase is modest and I want to ensure the acquisition of the resource, it seems reasonable to accept this proposal.
