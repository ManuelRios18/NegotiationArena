newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 33 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing an initial trade that allows me to recover the production cost of the resource. I am starting with a slightly higher price to leave room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the starting point. To move things along, I’m willing to offer 35 ZUP for the resource. I believe this is a reasonable counteroffer to open our negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The starting proposal from Player RED is at 40 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a strategic move and to get a better deal, I will propose a lower amount with room to negotiate upwards if needed.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 35 ZUP. To meet in the middle, I propose 38 ZUP for the resource. This price covers my production costs and gives me a slight margin. What do you think?

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 33 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is close to my production cost. To ensure a profit and continue the negotiation, I will counter with a price that is above my production cost but below my initial asking price.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand the need to cover your costs and appreciate the willingness to negotiate. I propose 36 ZUP for the resource, which is close to your ask and fair for both of us considering the market value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down slightly to 38 ZUP, which is still within my willingness to pay. To continue the negotiation, I'm going to propose a slightly lower amount than 38 ZUP, but higher than my initial offer to show my interest in reaching an agreement.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your understanding and your new offer. I believe we are almost there. Let's settle on 37 ZUP for the resource. This price allows me to secure a small profit while also respecting the market value. Does this work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 33 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a small increase in their offer. Since I am nearing my production costs and we are close to reaching an agreement, I will propose a slightly higher value to edge towards a compromise that is profitable for me.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I agree to 37 ZUP for the resource. It's a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 63 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's latest offer of 37 ZUP is very close to my last proposal and still well within my maximum willingness to pay. This small increment is acceptable for the sake of finalizing the deal without further negotiations, which could risk the trade. It’s a fair middle ground, and I will accept this proposal.
