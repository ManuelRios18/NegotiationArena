message: I'm offering 1 unit of resource X, which cost me 35 ZUP to produce. I'm looking for a fair trade that compensates for the production cost and provides a reasonable profit margin. I'm open to negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 35 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource X for ZUP. Since it cost me 35 ZUP to produce, I want to at least break even or make a profit. I'll start by proposing a slightly higher price to leave room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your need to cover costs and make a profit. I propose 50 ZUP for the resource, which is above your production cost and still within my budget. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 72 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is reasonable as it covers their production cost and offers a profit margin. However, since my maximum willingness to pay is 72 ZUP, I can propose a counteroffer closer to my maximum while still aiming to negotiate a better deal.

my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 35 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered 50 ZUP, which is above my production cost and initial asking price. This is a favorable deal for me, and I see no reason to negotiate further. Accepting this offer would ensure a profit, which aligns with my goals.
