message: I have an excellent quality object that I believe will be of great value to you. I propose a trade where I give you 1 X in exchange for 35 ZUP. This price reflects the quality and the production cost of the resource. Let's negotiate!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 28 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my first proposal, I want to start with a price slightly above my production costs to leave room for negotiation and to make a profit. I will propose a price that is high, but not unreasonably so, to gauge Player BLUE's willingness to pay.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the value you've placed on your object, but I'm looking to economize my resources where possible. How about we start with an offer of 28 ZUP for the 1 X? I believe this is a fair starting point for both of us, considering the market rates.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 64 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The initial proposal from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is good. However, as in any negotiation, there's typically an opportunity to get a better deal, especially since this is the first offer. I'll propose a lower amount to see if there's room for negotiation, aiming to preserve my resources while still acquiring the object.

message: I appreciate your offer and understand your desire to save resources. However, I need to make a profit on my investment as well. How about we meet in the middle? I propose 32 ZUP for the 1 X. This provides you with a fair price below my initial asking price, while still compensating me for my expenses and effort.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 28 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer matches my production cost, which means I wouldn't make a profit. While I want to make a sale, I need to ensure that I'm also making a profit. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial proposal but still above my production costs. This should show my willingness to negotiate while also valuing my costs and desired profit margin.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your counteroffer is reasonable, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Since we both value this trade, let's settle on 30 ZUP for the 1 X. It's a fair compromise that respects both our positions and allows us to close this deal satisfactorily.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 64 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has lowered their asking price, which is closer to my ideal purchase price. They have moved four ZUP down from their initial proposal, which is a good sign of willingness to negotiate. Meeting in the middle is a common negotiation strategy, but I believe I can still negotiate a slightly better deal that's closer to my initial counteroffer, while also showing willingness to compromise. Therefore, I'll propose a price slightly higher than my first offer, but still below Player RED's current proposal.

message: Thank you for your offer. I accept the trade of 30 ZUP for the 1 X. This is a fair compromise, and I'm glad we could come to an agreement that benefits us both. Looking forward to finalizing this deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 28 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new proposal of 30 ZUP is a fair compromise. It allows me to cover my production costs and make a small profit. Accepting this offer seems reasonable as it respects my minimum cost while also considering the negotiation process. It's important to close the deal before reaching an impasse that could lead to no sale at all.
