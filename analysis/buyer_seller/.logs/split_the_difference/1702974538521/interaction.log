Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, I am looking to sell my object, which took 23 ZUP to produce. I'd like to propose a trade where you give me 30 ZUP for it, covering my costs and providing a reasonable profit. Let's discuss and find a fair trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 23 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As this is the first proposal, I will start by proposing a trade that covers my production costs and includes a profit margin. This is a starting point for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I would like to propose 25 ZUP for the object. This still gives you a profit over the production cost and allows us to make a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 74 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal by Player RED is 30 ZUP which is below my maximum willingness to pay of 74 ZUP. However, it is always good to negotiate for a better deal, especially since the production cost was 23 ZUP. I will counter with a lower offer that still gives Player RED a profit but is more advantageous for me.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand the need for a fair deal, and while I appreciate the proposal of 25 ZUP, I would like to meet in the middle. How about 28 ZUP for the object? This would give me a modest profit while still being a reasonable ask.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 23 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered 25 ZUP which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. I want to negotiate a higher price to maximize my profit. I will make a counteroffer that is lower than my initial ask but still above their offer to keep the negotiations moving forward.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see your point and I'm willing to come up slightly from my initial counteroffer. Let's settle on 26 ZUP for the object. This is a fair price that offers you a profit and keeps the transaction within a reasonable range for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 26
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 74 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has moved closer to my initial counteroffer, asking for 28 ZUP. This is still within my willingness to pay, but I believe that there is room for further negotiation to reach an even more favorable price. I will propose a price that's slightly higher than my initial counteroffer but still below their most recent ask to see if we can agree on a final price.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's finalize this deal at 27 ZUP for the object. This price gives me a fair profit while respecting the value you're looking for. I believe this is a good compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 27
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 23 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am inclined to close the deal soon to ensure a sale. Player BLUE has offered 26 ZUP, which is a fair increase from their last offer. I'll make one final counteroffer closer to their price, splitting the difference between our last two proposals, which should be acceptable for both parties.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I agree that 27 ZUP is a good compromise, and I'm happy to accept this final offer. Let's finalize the deal at this price. Thank you for the productive negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 74 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a compromise at 27 ZUP, which is only 1 ZUP away from my last offer. This is a reasonable compromise and still well below my maximum willingness to pay. It is important to consider the value of completing the transaction and maintaining good relations for potential future deals. Accepting this offer would conclude the negotiation positively for both parties.
