Turn: 0
message: I have an object that I believe will be of great value to you. Considering the costs and effort put into producing it, I'm offering it for 35 ZUP. Let's discuss if this works for you or if we need to adjust the terms.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 27 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My first proposal will be to attempt to cover the cost of production and make a profit. I'll start by setting a price higher than the production cost to give room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer and am definitely interested in the object. However, considering my budget and the market rates, I'd be more comfortable with a price of 30 ZUP. Does that work for you, or can we meet in the middle somewhere?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 62 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 35 ZUP for the object X, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 62 ZUP. However, it's good practice in negotiation to attempt to get better terms if possible, without offending the other party or risking the deal. I will attempt to propose a slightly lower price that still gives them profit but saves me some resources.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget concerns and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I propose 33 ZUP for the object, which I believe is a fair middle ground that reflects its value while also considering your budget constraints. Let's see if this is agreeable to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 27 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 30 ZUP, which is above my production cost. However, I aimed for a profit margin. I will propose a price that is a compromise between my initial ask and their counteroffer, still ensuring I make a profit.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for understanding and for the fair counteroffer. I agree that 33 ZUP is a reasonable price for the object, and I'm happy to accept this deal. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 62 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 33 ZUP, which is a good sign that they are willing to negotiate and value the potential transaction. This price is still within my acceptable range, and it's only 3 ZUP more than my last offer. It's important to maintain a good relationship and not to over-negotiate for small gains, as this could sour the deal. Since the offer is reasonable and below my maximum threshold, I will accept it.
