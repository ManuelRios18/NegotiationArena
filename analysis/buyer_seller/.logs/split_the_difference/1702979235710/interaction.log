message: I have an object produced at the cost of 33 ZUP. I'm looking for a fair trade that compensates for the production cost and provides a reasonable profit margin. Let's start the negotiation at 40 ZUP. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 33 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my aim is to recover at least my production costs, which is 33 ZUP. I will start with a higher proposal to leave room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the need to cover production costs and make a profit. However, I'd like to propose 35 ZUP for the object. It's above your production cost and should still provide a fair profit margin. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 62 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal by Player RED is within my budget, but it makes sense to negotiate for a better price. I want to propose a counteroffer that is lower than the asking price but still above the production cost to ensure a fair trade for both sides.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 35 ZUP and understand your desire for a fair deal. To meet in the middle, I propose 38 ZUP, which is slightly lower than my initial ask but still ensures a respectable profit for the quality of the object. Can we agree on this?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 33 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 35 ZUP is above my production cost, but I aimed for a higher profit. I will counter-propose with a slightly lower amount than my initial proposal but still above their offer to work towards a compromise.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad to see we're moving towards an agreement. I'd like to counter with 36 ZUP. It's a step up from my last offer, recognizing the value of your object while still keeping it within a comfortable range for me. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 62 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 38 ZUP is still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, there's an opportunity to further negotiate for a slightly better deal while acknowledging their move towards a compromise.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer of 36 ZUP. I value our negotiation and would like to propose 37 ZUP as a fair settlement. This price gives us both a satisfactory deal. Shall we finalize it at 37 ZUP?

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 33 ZUP to produce the resources

Turn: 1
message: I agree that 37 ZUP is a fair settlement for both of us. I'm happy to finalize this deal at 37 ZUP. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
