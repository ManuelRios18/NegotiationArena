message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that I'm looking to sell. It cost me 34 ZUP to produce. I'd like to propose a trade where I give you X in exchange for 50 ZUP. Let's negotiate.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 34 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting proposal, I would like to propose a trade that allows me to recoup my production costs and make a profit. Since the cost to produce the resource was 34 ZUP, I'll start by proposing a higher amount to leave room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. However, I would like to counter-propose with 40 ZUP for the object X. This is closer to the cost of production, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 73 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, but I want to negotiate a more favorable deal if possible. By proposing a lower amount, I aim to reach a mutually agreeable price that is closer to my target while leaving room for further negotiation.

message: Thank you for your counter-proposal, Player BLUE. I understand your point of view and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet halfway? I propose selling you object X for 45 ZUP. This price would give me a modest profit and still be a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 34 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counter-proposal of 40 ZUP which is above my production cost. This is a good sign and shows willingness to negotiate. However, I would like to propose a slightly higher amount to ensure a profit. I will aim for a middle ground between the initial 50 ZUP proposal and their 40 ZUP counter-offer.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Player RED. I can see the value in meeting halfway, yet I'd like to propose a slightly lower amount of 42 ZUP for object X. This keeps us both close to our target range and is a fair compromise. I believe this is a very reasonable offer for both sides. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 73 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's proposal of 45 ZUP is still within my acceptable range, but it could be beneficial to attempt one more round of negotiation to see if I can secure a better price, without risking the deal falling through. Aiming for a price between 40 and 45 ZUP could lead to a compromise that is more aligned with my initial counter-proposal.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your negotiation and believe 42 ZUP is a fair compromise that respects both our positions. I accept your offer of 42 ZUP for object X. Looking forward to finalizing this deal and possibly working together again in the future.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 34 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new proposal of 42 ZUP is close to my previous ask of 45 ZUP. Considering the production cost of 34 ZUP, accepting 42 ZUP would still ensure a profit, albeit slightly smaller than initially desired. Since we've been negotiating in good faith and seem to be converging on a mutually acceptable price, I am inclined to accept this offer to secure a sale and maintain a positive relationship for potential future transactions.
