Turn: 0
message: As you know, the object I have is unique and it cost me 26 ZUP to produce. I am asking for 30 ZUP to cover my costs and gain a small profit, which I think is a fair deal considering its value and uniqueness.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 26 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I want to sell the object for more than it cost me to produce, I will start by proposing a price slightly higher to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the value and uniqueness of the object, but I would like to propose 28 ZUP for it. This allows you to still make a profit while giving me a slight discount. Let's work together to make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 66 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is well within my budget and below the maximum I'm willing to pay for the resource. It is a good starting point for negotiation, and I can propose a slightly lower amount to see if there is room for a better deal, but it is not necessary to go too low as the asking price is already reasonable.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 28 ZUP. Considering the uniqueness of the object, I would like to meet you halfway between your offer and my initial asking price. How about we settle for 29 ZUP? This way, both of us can benefit from the trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 29
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 26 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 28 ZUP is close to my asking price. I can still make a profit, but I believe the item's uniqueness justifies a higher price. I will propose a compromise that is slightly lower than my initial asking price but higher than the counteroffer.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your proposal sounds fair, and I am happy to meet you halfway. Let's finalize the deal at 29 ZUP for the unique object. Thank you for the negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 66 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 29 ZUP is only 1 ZUP more than my last proposal and still well below my maximum willingness to pay. It's a fair middle ground that gives both of us a satisfactory deal. Since the difference is minimal and the price is reasonable, it might be in my best interest to accept the offer and secure the trade.
