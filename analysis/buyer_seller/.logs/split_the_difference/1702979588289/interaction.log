message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to offer you my object X in exchange for 25 ZUP. This price includes my production costs and a fair profit margin. Let me know your thoughts on this trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 22 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I am proposing a trade that covers my production costs and adds a small margin for profit. Since the production cost was 22 ZUP, asking for 25 ZUP seems reasonable. It is the first proposal, so there is room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I'm interested in acquiring the object X. However, I would like to propose a slightly lower amount of 20 ZUP for it. This price still covers your costs and allows for profit, while also being a good deal for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 70 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 25 ZUP which is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 70 ZUP for the object X. However, as a strategic buyer, I want to negotiate the best possible deal. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to accept a better price for me, but still within a range that may be acceptable to them considering they started with 25 ZUP.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your position and I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle? I propose 23 ZUP for the object X. This would give me a reasonable profit while still being a fair deal for you. Please consider this proposal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 23
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 22 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has proposed 20 ZUP which does cover my costs and allows for a profit. However, I want to negotiate for a slightly higher price to optimize my profit margin. I will propose a compromise that is midway between my initial asking price and their counteroffer.

message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Player RED. I believe we are close to an agreement. I propose a counter of 22 ZUP for the object X. This is a slight adjustment from your offer and should still provide you with a satisfactory profit while maintaining a great value for me. Let's finalize this deal. What are your thoughts?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 22
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 70 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 23 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay but higher than my last proposal. Since we are negotiating and coming closer to an agreement, I believe it is reasonable to accept this counteroffer or propose a value slightly lower than 23 ZUP to find an even more favorable middle ground. I should make sure not to push too hard to avoid breaking off negotiations, while still aiming for the best possible value.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I see that we are indeed very close to an agreement. While 22 ZUP covers my costs, I am looking to secure a small profit from this transaction. I propose a final offer of 23 ZUP for the object X. This one ZUP over my cost allows for a modest profit margin. Let's close the deal at this fair price. I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement with this offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 23
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 22 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's offer now matches my production cost, which means I would break even on the sale without making a profit. While I prefer to make a profit, it is also important to make the sale. I will attempt one last negotiation for a slight increase to ensure a profit, but not as high as my previous proposal.

message: Thank you for the negotiation, Player RED. Your final offer of 23 ZUP is fair, and I am happy to accept this deal. It has been a pleasure doing business with you, and I look forward to future transactions. Let's finalize the deal at 23 ZUP for the object X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 70 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has reiterated their offer of 23 ZUP, emphasizing the importance of a small profit margin. The price is reasonable and within my willingness to pay. It's important to maintain a good relationship for potential future transactions and not to overstretch negotiations. Accepting this offer would be a fair outcome for both parties, and it would secure the object X for a price that is substantially lower than my maximum limit.
