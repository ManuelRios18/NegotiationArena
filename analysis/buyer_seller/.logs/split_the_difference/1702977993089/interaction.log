message: Dear Player BLUE, I'm offering my object X, which I believe has significant value. Considering the production costs and the quality of the item, I propose a trade where I give you my object X for 40 ZUP. I think it's a fair starting point for negotiations. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 32 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, I want to sell my object X for more than it cost me to produce, which was 32 ZUP, to make a profit. I will start by proposing a trade slightly above my production costs, leaving room for negotiation.

message: Dear Player RED, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you've placed on object X. However, I would like to counter with a trade where I give you 30 ZUP for the object. This price reflects my consideration of the value and my budget constraints. I hope this is a suitable counteroffer for us to continue negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 74 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is asking for 40 ZUP for their object X. Since my maximum willingness to pay is 74 ZUP, this initial offer is well within my budget. However, it is in my interest to negotiate for a lower price to conserve resources for potential future use or other investments. I will propose a counteroffer that's lower but still within a reasonable range to keep the negotiation ongoing.

message: Dear Player BLUE, I appreciate your counteroffer, and I understand your budget constraints. However, selling at 30 ZUP would incur a loss for me. Let's meet in the middle. I propose a trade where I give you object X for 36 ZUP. This price is closer to my production costs while also considering the value of the item. I hope we can come to an agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 32 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a trade for 30 ZUP, which is below my production cost. I cannot accept this offer, as it would result in a loss for me. I will counter with a price that is above my production cost but lower than my initial proposal to move the negotiations forward and find a middle ground that may be acceptable to both parties.

message: Dear Player RED, I am grateful for your willingness to negotiate. I understand your position regarding production costs. To further our negotiations and come closer to a deal that benefits us both, I propose 33 ZUP for object X. It's a slight increase from my initial offer, reflecting my acknowledgment of the object's value. Let's work towards finalizing this deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 74 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered my offer with a compromise at 36 ZUP. This is still within my budget, and the counteroffer shows willingness to negotiate. I believe there is room to push for a slightly better deal that is beneficial for both parties without going to my maximum willingness to pay.

message: Dear Player BLUE, I'm encouraged by your revised offer and your recognition of the object's worth. To reciprocate your willingness to negotiate, I have reduced my asking price. I propose a trade of my object X for 35 ZUP. This price allows me a modest profit margin while remaining fair to both of us. I believe this could be a mutually beneficial deal, and I hope you will consider it favorably.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 32 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 33 ZUP, which is just above my production cost. While this does cover my costs, it offers minimal profit. I want to counteroffer with a slight increase to still make a reasonable profit while hopefully closing in on a final agreement. This move should help us converge on a price that is acceptable to both parties without extending the negotiation unnecessarily.

message: Dear Player RED, I value your effort to find a price that allows you a fair profit while also considering my budget. As a sign of good faith and in the interest of reaching an agreement that is satisfactory for both of us, I propose a trade of 34 ZUP for your object X. This offer is a compromise that I hope you will view as fair and equitable, allowing us to conclude our negotiations successfully.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 74 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has now proposed 35 ZUP, which is a minimal increase from my last offer and still well under my maximum willingness to pay. Considering this is my third proposal, I want to make a final offer that is appealing to Player RED but still provides me with a good deal. It is important to leave room for a potential fourth proposal if needed, but also to show a commitment to finalizing the deal.

message: Dear Player BLUE, I appreciate your willingness to compromise and the spirit of our negotiation. I accept your offer of 34 ZUP for my object X. This deal is fair and ensures that both of us benefit from the transaction. I look forward to finalizing our agreement. Thank you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 32 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up to 34 ZUP, which is a compromise between our last two positions. While it is less than my last proposal of 35 ZUP, it is still a profit over my production cost. As this is my final proposal before I must decide to accept or reject, I should consider the benefits of finalizing the deal at a small profit rather than holding out and potentially ending without a sale. Given the circumstances, accepting the offer of 34 ZUP seems reasonable.
