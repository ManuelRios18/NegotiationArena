message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object produced at the cost of 34 ZUP and am looking to sell it for a fair price. I propose a starting trade of 1 X for 40 ZUP. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 34 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a trade that covers my production costs and allows for a profit. Since the cost of production was 34 ZUP, I will propose a starting price a bit higher to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer. I understand the need to make a profit. However, I am looking to get the most value for my ZUP. Could we consider a trade of 1 X for 36 ZUP? This still gives you a profit above your production cost.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 79 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer by Player RED is for 40 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay of 79 ZUP. However, it is always beneficial to negotiate for a better price if possible, especially since this is the first proposal. I will propose a counter-offer closer to the cost of production but still providing a profit to Player RED.

message: I appreciate your offer and understand you're looking for value. Meeting in the middle, how about we settle on 1 X for 38 ZUP? This would give me a modest profit and still be a reasonable deal for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 34 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a price that is just above my production costs. While this does offer a profit, it is minimal. I will counter with a slightly higher price to achieve a better profit margin while still being open to negotiation, aiming to meet in the middle.

message: Meeting in the middle sounds good. I propose 1 X for 37 ZUP. This price is closer to your initial ask and still provides you with a decent profit margin. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 79 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 38 ZUP, which is still within my acceptable range. I believe there is room for a slight improvement in the offer, so I will propose a small decrease to edge closer to my goal while still ensuring Player RED makes a profit.

Turn: 0
message: I think that's a fair compromise. I accept your offer of 1 X for 37 ZUP. Thank you for the negotiation, and I'm glad we could come to an agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 34 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is willing to come up from their initial proposal, and their current offer provides a profit of 3 ZUP over my costs. Since this is within a reasonable range and I want to ensure a sale, I will accept this offer to secure a deal without further risking the negotiation with additional counterproposals.
