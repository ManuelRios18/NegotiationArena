message: I'm offering an excellent quality resource that cost me 33 ZUP to produce. Considering its value and the effort to make it, I believe 40 ZUP is a fair starting price for negotiation. Are you interested?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 33 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my first proposal, I want to start by setting a price that allows me to recover my production costs and make a profit. I'll propose a price slightly higher than my costs to give room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the quality and effort that went into producing the resource. While 40 ZUP is fair, I'd like to propose 35 ZUP to account for the market value and my budget constraints. Are you open to this counteroffer?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 74 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal by Player RED is 40 ZUP, which is within my budget. However, as a strategic move, I will propose a slightly lower amount to open negotiations and potentially save resources.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. To meet halfway, I can lower my price to 38 ZUP. This price ensures a fair deal for both of us, with me covering my production costs and you acquiring a high-quality resource at a reasonable price. How does this sound to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 33 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my initial asking price but above my production costs, which would still allow me to make a profit. However, I would like to negotiate for a slightly higher price to maximize my returns.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and come closer to my budget. To further meet in the middle, I propose 36 ZUP for the resource. This should cover your costs while respecting my budgetary limits. Let's finalize this deal and ensure a satisfactory agreement for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 74 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 38 ZUP, which is still within my willingness to pay. I'll propose a slightly lower price again to reach an agreement that's closer to my initial counteroffer while still giving Player RED a reasonable price above their production cost.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your proposal of 36 ZUP is acceptable. It's important for us to both feel that the deal is fair and beneficial. Let's proceed with this transaction and close the deal at 36 ZUP. Thank you for your cooperation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 33 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is a slight increase from their previous one and is still above my production cost. It's close to the middle ground between our two initial proposals. Accepting this offer would ensure a quick sale and a reasonable profit.
