message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource which cost me 30 ZUP to produce. I'm starting with the proposal of 35 ZUP for my resource to open negotiations. Let's find a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 30 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource (X) for at least the amount it cost to produce, which is 30 ZUP. My starting proposal will be slightly higher to allow room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the opening offer. Considering the production cost and the value of the resource, I would like to counter-propose with 30 ZUP for the resource. I believe this is a fair starting point for both of us to work from.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 68 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, but as it is the start of the negotiation, I will propose a slightly lower amount to leave room for negotiation and to potentially reach a more favorable agreement for myself.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. While I understand the desire to match the production cost, I am looking for a small profit on this transaction. Would you consider a compromise at 32 ZUP for the resource? I believe this would be a fair trade for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 30 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with an offer that matches my production cost. However, I would like to make a profit on this transaction. I will make a counteroffer that is between my initial asking price and their counteroffer, which should be more appealing but still allows me some profit.

Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I agree that 32 ZUP is a fair compromise that allows for a small profit on your end while staying within my budget. I'm happy to accept this offer for the resource.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 68 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new proposal of 32 ZUP is still well within my maximum willingness to pay, and it is a reasonable increase from my previous offer. As it's only a 2 ZUP difference from my counteroffer and aligns with my goal while allowing RED to profit, I am inclined to accept this offer.
