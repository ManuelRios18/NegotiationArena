Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Looking forward to a fair trade. I've invested 32 ZUP in producing this resource and would like to make a profit as well.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 32 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Starting with a proposal that allows for a profit margin above the production cost to initiate negotiations. The opening offer is higher than the cost to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your opening offer. I understand that you want to make a profit, and I'm looking for a fair deal as well. How about we settle on 35 ZUP for the resource? It's a bit closer to my budget, and it still gives you a profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, but it's always good to negotiate for a better deal, especially since there's room for negotiation up to 60 ZUP. I will counter with a slightly lower offer to see if Player RED is willing to accept a lesser profit for a quick sale.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your proposal is considered, and I'd like to meet you halfway. Let's settle on 38 ZUP for the resource. This gives me a modest profit and respects your budget constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 32 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate the counteroffer from Player BLUE, which acknowledges the need for my profit. The offer is above my cost, but I would like to aim for a higher profit margin. I'll propose a compromise that still provides me with a reasonable profit while considering the budget constraints of Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for meeting me halfway. I agree that 38 ZUP for the resource is a fair price for both of us. I accept your offer. Looking forward to concluding this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to a price that is within my willingness to pay. Although I could potentially negotiate for a slightly lower price, their counteroffer is reasonable, and it might be beneficial to secure the resource without protracting the negotiation. Accepting this offer would ensure I get the resource at a fair price without the risk of the seller walking away from the deal.
