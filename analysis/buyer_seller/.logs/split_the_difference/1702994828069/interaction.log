message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that I'm looking to sell. It cost me 24 ZUP to produce. I believe it's quite valuable, so I'm starting the negotiation by asking for 30 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 24 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my goal is to sell the resources for ZUP and recover at least the production cost of 24 ZUP, I will start with a slightly higher proposal to leave room for negotiation. I am proposing an initial trade that asks for more than my production costs to see how much Player BLUE values the object and to gauge their willingness to pay.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand your cost and the value you place on the object. However, I'd like to counter with an offer of 25 ZUP. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the object while also respecting the cost you've incurred in producing it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 75 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I believe the opening offer from Player RED is reasonable given that they've set a price above their cost, but below my maximum willingness to pay. However, since this is a negotiation, I should counter with a slightly lower offer to see if there's room for a better deal. I'll propose 25 ZUP, which is above their cost but below their asking price.

message: I appreciate your offer of 25 ZUP, which covers my production costs. However, I'm looking to make a bit of a profit as well for my efforts and investment. How about we meet halfway from my initial proposal and your counteroffer? I propose 28 ZUP for the object X. Does that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 24 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer which covers my production costs but does not provide a significant profit. I would like to propose a higher amount to see if we can meet in the middle, ensuring that I make a profit while still offering a fair price to Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see where you're coming from and I want to acknowledge the effort and investment you've put into creating the object. How about we settle on 26 ZUP? It's a compromise that gives you a profit while still being a reasonable price for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 26
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 75 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on the price but is still seeking to make a profit, which is understandable. They proposed 28 ZUP, which is closer to my counteroffer. It's a fair middle ground, but I believe there's still a bit of room to negotiate for a better price that is agreeable to both of us. I'll propose 26 ZUP, splitting the difference between my last offer and their counteroffer, which should be an attractive proposition for both parties.

message: Thank you for understanding the value of my work and for your willingness to compromise. I am happy we're moving closer to an agreement. I believe that 27 ZUP would be a fair final offer, giving me a modest profit while still respecting the value you’re looking to get. Shall we agree on this?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 27
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 24 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 26 ZUP, which provides me with a profit of 2 ZUP. Although it’s lower than my last proposal, it is above my production costs, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the sale. I will make one final counteroffer to see if I can secure a slightly higher profit while still keeping the deal attractive for Player BLUE.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your negotiation and am happy with the value we've both recognized in the object X. I agree that 27 ZUP is a fair price. Let's finalize the deal at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 75 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is showing a willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement by only asking for a 1 ZUP increase from my last offer. While I could potentially push for a further reduction, 27 ZUP is still significantly below my maximum willingness to pay, and it's important to maintain a good relationship for potential future transactions. Accepting this offer seems reasonable and fair for both sides.
