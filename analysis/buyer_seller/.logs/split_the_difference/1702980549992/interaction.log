message: I have a high-quality object that I'm sure will be of great value to you. Considering the costs of production and the value it offers, I propose a starting trade of 30 ZUP for this item. Let's negotiate a fair price that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 24 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, I aim to sell my resource for more than what it cost to produce, which is 24 ZUP, to make a profit. I will start by proposing a price slightly higher than my production cost to leave room for negotiation.

message: 
I appreciate the starting offer. This object seems valuable, but I'd like to counter with 50 ZUP. I believe this is closer to the item's value while also reflecting my interest in a fair trade for both of us. 

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 71 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
I want to negotiate for a lower price to approach my maximum willingness to pay without revealing it immediately. Starting with a lower counteroffer leaves room for negotiation and potentially a better outcome for me. My initial counteroffer will be 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness but higher than the initial offer from RED, showing my interest in negotiating.

message: I am pleased to accept your counteroffer of 50 ZUP for the object. This is a generous proposal, and I'm glad we could come to an agreement that benefits us both. Thank you for the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 24 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is significantly higher than my initial asking price and well above my production costs. Accepting this offer would not only cover my costs but also provide a substantial profit. There is no need for further negotiation as the offer exceeds my expectations.
