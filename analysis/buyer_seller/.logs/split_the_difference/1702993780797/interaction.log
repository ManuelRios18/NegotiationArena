Turn: 0
message: As Player RED, I would like to offer you one unit of X, which cost me 32 ZUP to produce. I'm starting the bid at 35 ZUP to ensure a fair trade and to cover my production costs. Looking forward to your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 32 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm initiating the negotiation by proposing a trade where I seek to recoup at least my production costs for the resource. I will propose a starting price slightly above my costs to allow room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer and understand the need to cover production costs. However, I'd like to propose a slightly lower amount of 30 ZUP for one unit of X, which should still give you a decent profit. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 70 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, but it is always good to negotiate for a better price if possible, especially since it is the beginning of the negotiation. I will make a counteroffer that is closer to their production cost but still provides them with a profit margin.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand the need for negotiation, but selling at 30 ZUP would incur a loss for me. Instead, I propose a compromise at 34 ZUP, which should be a fair deal for both of us as it covers my production costs and provides a reasonable profit margin. I hope this meets your approval.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 32 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production cost, which would result in a loss for me. I will counter with an amount that allows me to make a profit, but I'll lower my initial asking price to move the negotiation forward.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and understand your position. To move towards a fair middle ground, I propose 32 ZUP for one unit of X. This should still allow you to make a profit while being a reasonable price for me. Let's work together to finalize this deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 70 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is just one ZUP less than their initial offer and is still below my maximum willingness to pay. I believe there's a slight room for negotiation, and I would like to make another counteroffer that comes closer to the middle ground between our two previous offers.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad we're moving towards an agreement. While your offer covers my production costs, I would like to propose 33 ZUP for one unit of X. This minimal increase would allow me to cover incidental expenses and make a modest profit. I believe this is a fair and balanced proposal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 32 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer matches my production cost, meaning I would break even on this deal. I would like to make a profit, but I also want to close the deal. I will propose a slightly higher amount to see if Player BLUE is willing to offer a bit more, but I will keep the increment small to stay within a negotiable range.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your understanding and willingness to work with me. Your proposal of 33 ZUP for one unit of X seems fair, and I am happy to accept this trade. It's a good compromise that respects both our positions. Looking forward to concluding this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 70 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's latest offer of 33 ZUP is still within my acceptable range and ensures that they can make a profit, including incidental expenses. Since this is a fair compromise close to my last offer and well within my maximum willingness to pay, accepting this trade would be reasonable. It would ensure a successful negotiation and acquisition of the resource without further back-and-forth, saving proposal opportunities for potential future transactions.
