message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my object, which cost me 33 ZUP to produce. I am proposing a starting trade where I give you 1 X in exchange for 40 ZUP. This covers my costs and gives me a small profit margin. Let me know if this works for you or if you would like to negotiate the price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 33 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resources for ZUP, and I need to at least cover my production costs of 33 ZUP. I will start by proposing a trade slightly above my costs to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hi Player RED, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can do better. I propose that you give me 1 X in exchange for 35 ZUP. This is still above your production cost and allows for a profit margin. Let's find a fair deal that benefits both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 80 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although the initial asking price of 40 ZUP is within my willing to pay limit, it's always beneficial to negotiate for a better price, especially since we have room for negotiation up to 80 ZUP. My counteroffer will move closer towards my upper limit while still trying to secure a better deal than the initial offer.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your position, but I'm looking for a slightly higher profit margin. I propose we meet halfway from our initial positions. How about you give me 38 ZUP in exchange for 1 X? This should provide a fair deal for both of us, considering the production costs and the value of the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 33 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counteroffer of 35 ZUP, which is slightly above my production cost. While this does give me a profit, I would like to negotiate for a higher price to ensure a better return on my investment. I will propose a middle ground between my initial ask and their counteroffer.

message: Player RED, your proposal of 38 ZUP for 1 X seems fair and is acceptable to me. Let's finalize this deal. Thank you for the negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 80 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable counteroffer that is still well within my budget. By accepting this offer, I would secure the object for less than my maximum willingness to pay. This negotiation is moving swiftly, and it seems like a good idea to accept a fair proposal that aligns with my goals and resources without further ado.
