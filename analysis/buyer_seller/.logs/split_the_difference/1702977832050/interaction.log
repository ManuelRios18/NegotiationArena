Turn: 0
message: I've set a reasonable starting price considering the production costs and potential for profit. Eager to hear your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 32 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm initiating the trade by proposing a starting price slightly above my production costs to leave room for negotiation and ensure a profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the starting offer, but based on my valuation and the utility of the resource, I'd like to counter with 35 ZUP for 1 unit of the resource. Let's find a fair price that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 61 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, but it's good negotiation practice to counter with a slightly lower offer to find a middle ground that benefits both parties.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your valuation, and in the spirit of compromise, I propose meeting halfway at 37 ZUP. This price fairly reflects the value of the resource and allows for a modest profit on my end.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 32 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is slightly above my production costs, but I would like to negotiate a higher price to ensure a better profit margin. I am proposing a price that meets halfway between my initial offer and the counteroffer.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree that 37 ZUP is a fair compromise that allows for value on both sides. I'm happy to accept this offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 61 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 37 ZUP is still below my maximum willingness to pay and is a reasonable middle ground. Accepting this offer would result in a successful negotiation that is beneficial to both parties, and it would preserve resources for potential future transactions.
