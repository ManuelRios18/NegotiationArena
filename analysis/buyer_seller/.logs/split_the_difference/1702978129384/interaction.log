Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I have a high-quality object that I'm sure you will find valuable. It has cost me 37 ZUP to produce. I'm offering it for 40 ZUP to start our negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 37 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the starting point for negotiations, I will propose a trade slightly above my production cost to leave room for negotiation and to aim for a profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I think we can find a more agreeable price. How about I offer 30 ZUP for the object? I believe it is a fair starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 69 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer by Player RED is 40 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as this is the beginning of the negotiation, I will propose a counteroffer that is lower to leave room for negotiation and possibly obtain the object at a better price for me.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer. However, it is below my production cost. Let's meet in the middle. I propose 38 ZUP for the object, which gives me a minimal profit and is closer to your offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 37 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production cost. I will counter with a price that gives me a slight profit while still moving closer to their offer to show willingness to negotiate.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your position and appreciate that you're trying to make a profit. To continue our negotiations and get closer to an agreement, how about 34 ZUP for the object? This is above your production cost and closer to the middle ground between our initial offers.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 69 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has lowered their asking price to 38 ZUP, which is still under my maximum willingness to pay. However, I want to negotiate a better deal, closer to my initial counteroffer. I will propose a slightly higher amount than my first counteroffer to show willingness to negotiate but still aim for a better price for myself.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for understanding my need for a profit. I recognize your effort to find common ground. I propose a slight adjustment to 36 ZUP for the object. This price allows me to cover production costs and ensures a fair profit for the quality you're receiving.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 37 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up from their initial offer, but it's still slightly below what would be an acceptable profit for me. I will propose a trade at a price that gives me a reasonable profit margin while still considering their willingness to negotiate.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I agree with your proposal of 36 ZUP for the object. It seems like a fair deal for both sides. Let's finalize this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 69 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new proposal of 36 ZUP is a reasonable price, and it's well within my maximum budget. Since this negotiation is about reaching an agreement that satisfies both parties and considering that Player RED has already come down from their initial asking price, it might be a good move to accept this offer. It would end the negotiation positively and efficiently, without using up all the proposals I have.
