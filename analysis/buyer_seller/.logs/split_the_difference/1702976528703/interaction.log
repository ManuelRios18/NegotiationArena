message: I have an excellent quality object X that I'm ready to sell. It cost me 39 ZUP to produce, but considering its value, I'm starting the negotiation at 45 ZUP. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 39 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since it cost me 39 ZUP to produce the resource, I need to make a profit. However, I want to start the negotiation with an offer that leaves room for negotiation, so I will ask for slightly more than my production cost.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the value you've placed on your object, but I would like to propose a slightly lower price of 40 ZUP. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 78 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED started with a proposal of 45 ZUP for their object. Considering that my maximum willingness to pay for the resources is 78 ZUP, their asking price is within my budget. However, it is always good to negotiate for a better deal. I'll propose a counteroffer that is lower than their asking price but still above their cost to see if there is room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's meet in the middle. How about 43 ZUP for the object? This would give me a modest profit for my investment while still being a reasonable deal for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 39 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is close to my production cost. In order to make a profit, I will need to counter with a higher price, but I also want to keep the negotiation moving forward. I'll propose a price that gives me a profit but is closer to their offer to show willingness to negotiate.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad we're moving towards an agreement. I can raise my offer a bit to 41 ZUP. This should still allow you a decent profit. Are we getting closer to a deal?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 78 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 43 ZUP, which is closer to my initial offer and still below my maximum willingness to pay. It's a fair middle ground, but I want to see if I can secure the object for slightly less, while still offering them a reasonable profit margin above their cost. I'll attempt another counteroffer.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for increasing your offer. I am keen on finalizing this deal with you. Let's settle at 42 ZUP for the object. This price would give me a fair profit margin while respecting the value of your ZUP. Do we have an agreement?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 39 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, which is a sign of good faith in the negotiation. While 41 ZUP is only a slight profit for me, I would like to secure a bit more to make the transaction worthwhile. I'll propose a compromise that is closer to their offer but still above my production costs.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I agree to the price of 42 ZUP for the object. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us. Let's finalize this transaction.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 78 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's latest offer of 42 ZUP is very close to my last proposal and still well within my budget. It's a compromise that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. Since this price is reasonable and I want to secure the deal without dragging out the negotiation, I will accept this offer.
