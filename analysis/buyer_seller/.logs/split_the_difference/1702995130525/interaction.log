Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the initial offer, and I recognize the value of the object. However, I'd like to propose a revised trade where I give you 50 ZUP for the object X. I believe this is closer to the fair market value and leaves room for both of us to find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 72 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to start the negotiation with a counteroffer closer to the maximum amount I am willing to pay, while still leaving room for further negotiation if necessary. By proposing a trade at a lower amount than my maximum willingness to pay, I am attempting to reach a more favorable outcome while also showing willingness to negotiate.
