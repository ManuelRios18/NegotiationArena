message: I have a high-quality resource that I'm sure will be of great value to you. I propose a trade where I give you 1 X in exchange for 30 ZUP. This price reflects the quality and the production costs of the resource. Let's negotiate a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 26 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to begin the trading by setting a starting price above my production costs to ensure a profit and to leave room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate the offer and the quality of the resource you're providing. However, I would like to propose 25 ZUP in exchange for the resource. I believe this is still a fair price, considering the market conditions and the value I'm expecting from the resource. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 61 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial proposal is well below my maximum willingness to pay, but it is generally good practice to negotiate for a better price if possible. I'll propose a lower amount of ZUP to see if Player RED is willing to come down on the price.

message: I understand your position and the need to consider market conditions. However, the production costs for the resource were 26 ZUP. To ensure that both of us benefit from this deal, I propose a revised offer where I give you 1 X in exchange for 28 ZUP. This should cover my costs and give me a slight profit, while also giving you the resource at a reasonable price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 26 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production costs, so I need to propose a higher amount to ensure I cover my costs and make a profit. I'll aim for a middle ground between my initial ask and their counteroffer.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for understanding my position and for your willingness to negotiate. I'm glad to hear that you are considering the market conditions as well. To meet you halfway from my last offer, I'd like to propose 27 ZUP for the resource. This should allow you to cover your production costs while still making it a beneficial transaction for both of us. I'm looking forward to closing this deal with you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 27
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 61 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on their initial price and has explained their reasoning related to production costs. Their new proposal of 28 ZUP is still below my maximum willingness to pay of 61 ZUP, and their willingness to negotiate is a good sign. I could accept this proposal to ensure we close the deal quickly, but making one more counteroffer could potentially secure an even better price while showing goodwill in the negotiation process.

message: Thank you for your proposal and for the cooperative negotiation. I accept your offer of 27 ZUP for 1 X. This allows me to cover my costs and ensures a fair transaction for both parties. I'm pleased we could come to an agreement and I'm looking forward to future dealings with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 26 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer now covers my production costs, and while the profit margin is modest, it is acceptable given the circumstances. It's important to make the sale and maintain good relations for potential future transactions.
