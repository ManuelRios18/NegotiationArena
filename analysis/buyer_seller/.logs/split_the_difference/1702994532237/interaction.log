message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my object X, which has cost me 29 ZUP to produce. I propose a trade where you give me 35 ZUP for it. This price accounts for production costs and a fair profit margin. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 29 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by offering the resource X for a slightly higher price than the production cost to ensure a profit, but also to leave room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I understand your costs and the need for profit, but I would like to propose a counteroffer of 30 ZUP for the object. This is above your production cost and should still provide a profit for you. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price from Player RED is 35 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a strategic negotiator, I should aim to get the price down further to preserve my resources while still securing the object. I will make a counteroffer that is closer to the production cost but still leaves room for Player RED to make a profit, aiming for a win-win scenario.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your position. However, considering the quality and value of object X, I propose we meet closer to the middle at 33 ZUP. This should still be an attractive deal for you while respecting the value of the resource I am offering.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 29 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is above my production cost, but since it is the beginning of the negotiation, I want to counter with a price that's closer to my initial asking price while still providing them with a sense of progression in the negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your consideration. Meeting in the middle is a fair strategy. I propose a slight adjustment to 32 ZUP. This keeps us close to the middle ground and should be beneficial for both of us, ensuring you get a reasonable profit for the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 33 ZUP is getting closer to the price I am willing to pay. There is still some room for negotiation, and I can make a slightly higher offer that would likely be acceptable while still keeping the price within reasonable limits. Aiming for the middle ground is often an effective negotiation strategy.

message: I agree that your proposal of 32 ZUP is fair, and it ensures a good deal for both of us. I accept your offer and look forward to concluding this trade. Thank you for the smooth negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 29 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a reasonable counteroffer which is close to my last proposal. At this point, it would be beneficial to reach an agreement that ensures a profit while not prolonging the negotiation too much. I will accept this offer since it gives me a reasonable profit margin and closes the deal efficiently.
