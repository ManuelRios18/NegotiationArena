Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I am offering one unit of resource X, which has a production cost of 33 ZUP. Considering its value, I propose an exchange for 35 ZUP to cover costs and provide a fair profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 33 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a starting trade that attempts to recoup the production cost of the resource, while also leaving room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the need for a profit margin, but I would like to counter with an offer of 33 ZUP for one unit of resource X. This should cover your production costs and give you a fair return, while also being a good deal for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 64 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The asking price of 35 ZUP for one unit of resource X is within my budget, and it allows for a small profit for Player RED. It's slightly above the production cost, which seems fair. However, I would like to negotiate a slightly better deal if possible, aiming to preserve some of my resources while still closing a deal that's acceptable for both parties. I will propose a counteroffer that is closer to the production cost but still allows for a profit margin for Player RED.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer to cover production costs. However, I would like to make a small profit for this transaction to be worthwhile. Would you consider a compromise at 34 ZUP for the resource? This still gives you a discount from my initial asking price and allows me a minimal profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 33 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer exactly matches my production costs, leaving no profit. I will counter with a slightly reduced price from my initial offer to move towards a compromise that allows for a profit on my end.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your proposal for 34 ZUP seems reasonable and fair. I am willing to accept this offer. Let's proceed with the trade at your proposed price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 64 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down from their initial asking price, which shows a willingness to negotiate. The new offer of 34 ZUP is only 1 ZUP above my counteroffer and is still well within the maximum I am willing to pay for the resource. It's a fair price that allows Player RED to make a profit while keeping the transaction economical for me. Accepting this offer would also save proposal turns for potential future trades.
