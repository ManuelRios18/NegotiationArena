message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that cost me 35 ZUP to produce. I'm looking to sell it for a fair price that compensates for the production costs and provides me with a profit. I'd like to propose a trade where I give you X in exchange for 40 ZUP. Let me know your thoughts or if you have a counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 35 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As this is the first proposal, I want to start with a price that gives me a profit margin while also leaving room for negotiation. I'll propose a price slightly above my production cost.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I understand the need for a profit on your side. How about we meet in the middle? I propose I give you 37 ZUP for X, ensuring you still make a profit while keeping the deal attractive for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 62 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is good. However, as a strategic move, I should try to negotiate for a lower price to save resources while still reaching an agreement that is acceptable for both parties. I'll propose a slightly lower price that is still above their production cost to ensure they make a profit, aiming for a middle ground.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to ensure we both have a good deal. To further meet in the middle, I propose 38 ZUP for X. This still gives me a modest profit while also considering your position. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 35 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer which is still above my production costs, so it's a profitable proposal. I can accept this offer or try to negotiate for a slightly higher amount to maximize profit. Given that this is a negotiation, I'll counter with a slightly higher amount but still less than my initial proposal to show willingness to compromise.

message: I agree with your proposal of 38 ZUP for X. It is a fair price for both of us, and I'm happy to proceed with this trade. Thank you for the negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 62 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down from the initial offer and is now asking for 38 ZUP, which is still within my acceptable range and very close to my counteroffer. It's only a ZUP difference from my last proposal, and accepting this offer would allow me to save ZUP for other potential transactions while also closing the deal efficiently. It seems reasonable to accept this offer.
