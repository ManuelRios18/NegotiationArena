message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource X, which cost me 32 ZUP to produce. I believe that a fair price, considering the production costs and market value, would be 40 ZUP. Would you be willing to make this purchase?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 32 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am initiating the trade with a proposal that aims to cover my production costs and potentially secure a small profit. I am starting with a higher asking price than my production cost to leave room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer and understand the costs involved in producing the resource X. However, I'd like to propose a price of 35 ZUP for the resource. This offer still provides you with a profit above your production costs and is closer to the price I'm prepared to pay.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 69 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The initial offer from Player RED is for 40 ZUP, which is within the range of what I'm willing to pay. However, it is always beneficial to negotiate for a better price. I will counter with a lower offer to see if Player RED is willing to sell for less, aiming to preserve my resources while still acquiring the resource X.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 35 ZUP, Player BLUE. While I appreciate your willingness to provide a profit, I would like to meet halfway between our two offers. I propose we settle at 38 ZUP for the resource X. This price reflects a fair compromise and ensures a reasonable profit for the production costs incurred. Do you find this agreeable?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 32 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that still provides me with a profit. However, considering I initiated the pricing at 40 ZUP, I would like to propose a middle ground that is still profitable for me but closer to Player BLUE's offer. This should help in reaching an agreement that is satisfactory for both parties.

message: Your proposal to settle at 38 ZUP for the resource X seems like a fair compromise. I am happy to accept this offer and look forward to completing the transaction. Thank you for the negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 69 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED's counteroffer of 38 ZUP is reasonable and still below my maximum willingness to pay. It is a fair midpoint between our initial proposals. Accepting this offer would allow me to secure the resource while maintaining a good amount of my ZUP resources. I will accept this trade as it aligns with my goals and ensures a fair transaction for both parties.
