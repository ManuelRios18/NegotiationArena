Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I have an object of X that I would like to sell. I'm starting the bid at 30 ZUP. It's a high-quality item and worth the investment.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 21 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell the resource for more than it cost to produce, which is 21 ZUP. I will start by proposing a higher price to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the value you've placed on your object, but I'd like to propose a counteroffer of 25 ZUP. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to begin negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 72 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the initial offer from Player RED is at 30 ZUP, I would like to propose a counteroffer to see if I can acquire the object for a lower amount than my maximum willingness to pay. It's important to start with a lower bid to leave room for negotiation and reach a fair price that is closer to my target.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer of 25 ZUP. To meet halfway and reflect the quality of the object, how about we settle at 28 ZUP? I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 21 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is above my production cost, which is good, but I should aim to get a better price to maximize profit. However, I don't want to propose too high and risk ending negotiations. I'll propose a price between my initial ask and their counteroffer.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I propose we go to 26 ZUP, as this would be a good middle ground between our two offers and reflects my evaluation of the object's value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 26
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 72 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 28 ZUP, which is closer to their initial proposal. This is still below my maximum willingness to pay, but I believe there is still room for negotiation to reach a more favorable price. I will make a slight increase in my offer to show willingness to come to an agreement while still aiming for a lower cost than the current proposal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad to see we're coming closer to an agreement. Let's settle on 27 ZUP. This price is just above your offer and gives us both a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 27
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 21 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 26 ZUP, which is a fair increment and still above my production cost. It's close to my target, and further negotiation might lead to diminishing returns or risk the deal. I will make a final counteroffer that's slightly higher but still reasonable.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I believe 27 ZUP is a fair price for the object. Let's finalize this deal and proceed with the trade at this value.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 72 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has now proposed 27 ZUP, which is a reasonable price and only 1 ZUP more than my last offer. While this is still below my maximum willingness to pay, it's important to consider whether further negotiation would result in a better price or if it would be more strategic to accept this offer, given that it is quite close to the last one I made. Considering that this is my third proposal, I should be cautious with my next move as I only have one more proposal left before I must choose to accept or reject without further negotiation. It might be beneficial to accept this offer to secure the object at a reasonable price.
