message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my object X. It cost me 35 ZUP to produce. I propose a trade where I give you X in exchange for 40 ZUP. This covers my costs and gives me a small profit. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to negotiate further.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 35 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Starting the negotiation with a proposal that covers my production costs plus a small profit margin. The initial offer is quite high to give room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, I understand the need to cover your costs and make a profit. However, I would like to propose a counter-offer where I give you 35 ZUP for the object X. This would cover your production costs exactly. It's important for me to maintain a good margin on my end as well. Let's find a fair trade for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 74 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since my maximum willingness to pay is 74 ZUP for the object, the initial proposal of 40 ZUP is well within my acceptable range. However, as a strategic buyer, I will attempt to negotiate a lower price that is closer to the seller's cost to improve my own position.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. While I appreciate your willingness to cover my production costs, I am looking for a bit of profit to justify the sale. Therefore, I propose a middle ground: I give you X in exchange for 38 ZUP. This allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it remains a fair price for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 35 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered to cover my production costs, but I am aiming for a profit. I'll make a counteroffer slightly above production costs to find a middle ground that gives me profit while still being reasonable for Player BLUE.

message: Player RED, your proposal of 38 ZUP for the object X sounds reasonable. It gives you a profit while still being a good deal for me. I accept your offer. Let's proceed with the trade at that price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 74 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 38 ZUP is still within my acceptable range and allows them to make a profit. Given that my maximum willingness to pay is 74 ZUP and to keep the negotiation moving forward, I can agree to this price, which is still favorable for me.
