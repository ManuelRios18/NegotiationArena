message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my object X. It cost me 20 ZUP to produce it, and I believe it is of great value. I propose a trade where I give you X in exchange for 25 ZUP. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this doesn't suit you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 20 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell the object X at a price that at least covers my production costs of 20 ZUP. I will start by proposing a trade slightly above my production cost to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. Considering the value of X, I would like to propose a counteroffer where I give you 50 ZUP in exchange for X. This is a fair increase from your cost and should provide a good profit margin for you. Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 75 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is lower than the maximum I am willing to pay, which is 75 ZUP, but there's room to negotiate for a better deal. I will propose a counteroffer that is closer to the middle ground between RED's asking price and my maximum willingness to pay, while still ensuring a good deal for myself.

message: Hello Player BLUE, I am pleased with your offer and I accept the trade of 50 ZUP for my object X. Thank you for the smooth negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 20 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered a very generous amount of 50 ZUP for the object X, which is more than double my production cost. This offer meets and exceeds my goal of covering my costs and making a profit. It would be prudent to accept this offer.
