message: I have a high-quality object X that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm starting the bidding at 30 ZUP. Let's negotiate a fair price for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my goal is to sell the object X for ZUP and it cost me 25 ZUP to produce, I want to at least break even. My initial proposal will be higher to leave room for negotiation, so I will ask for 30 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I think the starting bid is a bit high for me. How about we go with 50 ZUP for object X? It's a more comfortable starting point for negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 73 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to start negotiations by offering a lower price than my maximum willingness to pay, leaving room for further negotiation and to see if Player RED will accept a lower offer.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your generous offer, I accept the trade of 50 ZUP for my object X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: It seems there was a misunderstanding in the initial messages as Player BLUE has proposed a higher amount than what I requested. This is a favorable outcome and I should accept this offer since it is double what I initially invested in producing resource X.
