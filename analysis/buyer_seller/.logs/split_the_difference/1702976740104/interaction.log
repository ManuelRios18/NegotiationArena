message: I am offering my high-quality object X for a fair price of 30 ZUP. Consider that it cost me 26 ZUP to produce, so this is a competitive offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 26 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my object at a price higher than my cost of production, which is 26 ZUP. I will start by offering a slightly higher price to leave room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: I'm interested in your object X, but I'd like to propose a price of 28 ZUP. This should still give you a decent profit margin, and it's closer to my budget for this purchase.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 66 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is good. However, it is always beneficial to negotiate for a better price if possible, especially at the beginning of a negotiation. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to consider it.

message: I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. However, to reflect the quality of the object and my production costs, I'd like to meet in the middle at 29 ZUP. This price should be acceptable for both of us, offering you value and me a reasonable profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 29
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 26 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is close to the production cost, leaving a small profit margin. I will counter with a slightly higher price to ensure a better profit while still keeping the offer attractive to Player BLUE.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I agree that 29 ZUP is a fair middle ground for both of us. I'm happy to accept this offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 66 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 29 ZUP, which is a sign of good faith in the negotiation process. This price is still below my maximum willingness to pay. It's usually good to keep negotiations going to find the best middle ground, but considering the price is within range and the seller has already moved closer to my initial counter-offer, it might be beneficial to accept this offer to ensure a good relationship for potential future transactions.
