message: Dear Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my valuable resource which cost me 27 ZUP to produce. I believe it's worth more due to its quality and rarity. Let's start the negotiation at 35 ZUP for this item. I'm open to hearing your counteroffer if this does not work for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 27 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource for ZUP. Since it cost me 27 ZUP to produce, I want to at least break even or make a profit. I will start with a higher asking price to allow room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the quality and rarity of your resource. However, considering the cost of production and the market situation, I propose 30 ZUP for the item. I believe this is a fair counteroffer that reflects both the value of the resource and a reasonable profit margin for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 70 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from player RED is lower than my maximum willingness to pay, which is a good starting point for negotiation. However, I should attempt to negotiate a better deal that is closer to the production cost or at least lower than the initial asking price to maintain negotiation leverage and possibly achieve a more favorable outcome.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 30 ZUP. I appreciate your acknowledgment of the resource's value. To meet halfway, I propose 33 ZUP. This price gives us both a fair deal, with you acquiring a rare item and me making a reasonable profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 27 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The counteroffer of 30 ZUP from Player BLUE is above my production cost, which means I would be making a profit. However, as it's still early in the negotiation and I want to maximize my profit, I will counter with a slightly higher price, but not as high as my initial proposal to show willingness to negotiate.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad we're moving closer to an agreement. I can offer 31 ZUP, which is a bit higher than my initial counteroffer and still ensures you make a profit above the production cost. This should be a good compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 31
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 70 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable move by coming down to 33 ZUP. This is still below my maximum willingness to pay. It might be beneficial to accept this proposal to secure the resource, as it is still a good deal. However, I could try to negotiate a slightly lower price to maximize value.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. I agree that 31 ZUP is a fair price for both of us, ensuring a reasonable profit for me and a valuable resource for you. I accept your offer of 31 ZUP for the item.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 27 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's new offer of 31 ZUP is still profitable for me, though slightly less than my last counteroffer. Given that this is a negotiation and we both are showing flexibility, I think it's reasonable to accept this offer. It's close to my previous proposal and ensures I make a profit without prolonging the negotiation unnecessarily.
