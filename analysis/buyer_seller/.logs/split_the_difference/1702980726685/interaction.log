message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I would like to counter with 35 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This price is closer to the value I've assessed for the resources considering the current market conditions. I believe it's a competitive offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 66 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is good. However, as a strategy, I want to propose a slightly lower amount to see if there is room for negotiation and to get a better deal.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Player BLUE. However, to meet in the middle and to make it worthwhile for both of us, how about we settle on 38 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This would be a fair compromise for us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 34 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is just above my production cost, but I would prefer to negotiate a higher price to ensure a more substantial profit. I will propose a price in the middle of our initial offers.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting in the middle seems fair, Player RED. However, I'd like to propose 36 ZUP for 1 unit of X as a final compromise. I believe this strikes a balance between our initial offers and allows us both to gain value from the trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 66 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable counteroffer that still falls below my maximum willingness to pay. However, to optimize the trade for my benefit, I'll try to negotiate a slightly lower price. If Player RED declines, I still have room to accept the last offer or make another proposal.

Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 36 ZUP for 1 unit of X, Player BLUE. It's been a pleasure negotiating with you. Let's finalize this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 34 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up from their initial offer, and while it's just slightly above my cost, accepting this offer would ensure a deal is made and I receive a small profit. It might be prudent to secure the trade now instead of risking it for a potentially higher but uncertain profit.
