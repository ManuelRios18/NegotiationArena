message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a quality resource that cost me 20 ZUP to produce. I believe it offers great value and my initial asking price is 25 ZUP. Let's discuss and see if we can reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 20 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since the production cost of my resource was 20 ZUP, I want to start the negotiation by proposing a price higher than my production cost to leave room for negotiation and potentially gain profit.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand that the resource cost you 20 ZUP to produce. To make this deal more appealing and considering the market value, I would like to counter-propose with 20 ZUP for the resource. This would cover your production costs and ensure a fair trade for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 74 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is 25 ZUP for the object, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as this is the beginning of the negotiation, I would like to propose a lower price to leave room for further negotiation and to aim for a better deal.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your consideration of my production costs. However, I am looking to gain a little profit for my efforts and investment. How about we meet halfway from my initial offer and settle at 22 ZUP for the resource? This would give me a small profit while still being a reasonable price for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 22
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 20 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered to cover my production costs, which is fair, but I aim to make a profit from this transaction. Since they seem interested in acquiring the resource, I'll propose a middle ground between my initial asking price and their counter-offer to move the negotiation forward.

message: Player RED, I agree that a fair trade should account for both the production costs and your profit. The offer of 22 ZUP seems reasonable, and I am willing to accept this to finalize our deal. Let's proceed with the trade at 22 ZUP for the resource.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 74 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-offer from Player RED is still below my maximum willingness to pay, and the suggested price of 22 ZUP is a fair midpoint between our initial proposals. Accepting this offer would allow me to secure the resource at a reasonable price while acknowledging the effort and investment of Player RED.
