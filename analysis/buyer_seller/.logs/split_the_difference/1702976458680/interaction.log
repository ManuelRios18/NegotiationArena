message: I'm offering my resource which cost me 25 ZUP to produce. I believe 30 ZUP is a fair price considering the production costs and the quality of the resource. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource for ZUP. Since it cost me 25 ZUP to produce, I'll start by proposing a trade that gives me a profit. However, I don't want to start with a too high amount which might discourage Player BLUE from negotiating. I'll propose a trade at a slightly increased rate to open up the negotiation and see how Player BLUE values the resource.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the production cost and the quality of the resource you are offering. I'd like to propose 28 ZUP for the resource, considering the market value and the quantity I'm willing to purchase. I believe this could be an acceptable compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 76 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 30 ZUP, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay. However, it is in my interest to negotiate the price down as much as possible without offending the other player or risking the deal. I will propose a slightly lower price to see if there is room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your offer of 28 ZUP and understand your consideration of market value. Let's meet in the middle and agree on 29 ZUP. This price reflects both the quality of the resource and a fair compromise for the both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 29
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 28 ZUP. While this is above my production cost, I initially aimed for a higher profit margin. However, it's close to my asking price, and I want to encourage further negotiation without losing the deal. I'll propose a slightly higher amount, splitting the difference between my original ask and their counteroffer, showing willingness to negotiate but still aiming for a reasonable profit.

Turn: 1
message: I agree that 29 ZUP is a fair price for the resource, reflecting both the quality and a fair compromise. I accept your offer of 29 ZUP for the resource. Looking forward to future dealings!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 76 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 29 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. Since Player RED has shown a willingness to negotiate and has only moved by 1 ZUP, accepting this offer would be reasonable. It is a fair price, and further negotiation might not yield a better result and could potentially sour the deal. I will accept this trade.
