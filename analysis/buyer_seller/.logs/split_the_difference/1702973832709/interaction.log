message: I'm looking to sell my object X which cost me 39 ZUP to produce. I believe that 45 ZUP would be a fair trade to start our negotiations, taking into account the cost of production and a reasonable profit margin. Let me know what you think.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 39 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a starting trade that would allow me to recoup my production costs with a small profit margin. This is a starting point for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer and the transparency regarding your production costs. I believe in fair trade but would like to propose a counteroffer of 40 ZUP for the object. This is a bit closer to the production cost but still offers a profit for your efforts. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 75 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal by Player RED is asking for 45 ZUP which is within my budget. However, as a strategic move and to get the best possible deal, I will propose a counteroffer that is lower than the asking price but still within a reasonable range to keep the negotiation going. I will propose 40 ZUP, which gives us room for further negotiation if necessary.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I'm glad we're working towards a fair agreement. How about we meet halfway between my initial proposal and your counteroffer? I propose a trade of 42 ZUP for my object X. This gives me a modest profit while also being considerate of the value you're looking for.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 39 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is just above my production cost. I want to propose a counteroffer that splits the difference between my initial asking price and their counteroffer, which should be acceptable to both parties and still give me a reasonable profit.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I acknowledge your willingness to meet halfway, and I appreciate the consideration. Let's narrow it down even further to 41 ZUP. This price is fair to both of us, taking into account both your production costs and my valuation of the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 75 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable counteroffer of 42 ZUP, which is still within my budget. It's a fair midpoint between our two offers. However, there might still be room to negotiate a slightly better deal. I'll attempt a second counteroffer that is a bit lower than 42 ZUP but still shows my willingness to reach an agreement close to Player RED's expectations, which should facilitate a successful negotiation.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 41 ZUP for the object X. I think this is a fair and equitable trade for both parties. I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 39 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a proposal that is still above my production cost, providing a small profit. I believe this is a fair deal, and further negotiation may be counterproductive and risk the sale. Accepting this offer would fulfill my goal of selling the object for more than it cost to produce.
