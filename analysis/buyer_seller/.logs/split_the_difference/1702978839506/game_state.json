I understand your need for a profit, and I'm willing to come up a bit on my previous offer. How about one unit of X for 25 ZUP?

Since we're nearing a fair agreement and to show my goodwill in this negotiation, I can increase my offer slightly while still keeping it below the proposed 27 ZUP. This should indicate my interest in closing the deal soon while also maintaining a good value for the purchase. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 26 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED.

I'm hoping we can finalize this deal with this offer. </message>"
