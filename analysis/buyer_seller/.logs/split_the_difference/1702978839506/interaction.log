message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to offer you one unit of X for 30 ZUP. This is a premium product that has cost me quite a bit to produce, and I believe it's worth the value. I'm open to hearing your counteroffer if this doesn't work for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the first proposal, I want to start by setting a price that allows me to recoup my production costs and make a profit. However, I'm also aware that starting too high might discourage Player BLUE from trading. Therefore, I will propose a trade slightly above my cost of production to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand the value of the product, but I would like to counter with 20 ZUP for one unit of X. This offer still gives you a reasonable profit while being within my budget. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. I am willing to pay at most X: 74 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 30 ZUP, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as with any negotiation, it's standard to counter-offer with a lower amount to arrive at a mutually beneficial agreement. I'll propose a trade that's closer to the middle ground between 0 and my maximum willingness to pay, aiming for a better deal while leaving room for further negotiation.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Player BLUE. However, 20 ZUP is below my production costs. I believe that a fair trade for both of us would be one unit of X for 28 ZUP. This price gives me a modest profit while still being reasonable for the quality of the product. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with 20 ZUP, which is below my production cost. I need to negotiate a higher price to ensure I make a profit. I would like to meet somewhere in the middle between our two offers. I'll propose a price that's slightly above my production cost, which should be a fair compromise.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my offer. I understand your need for a profit, and I'm willing to come up a bit on my previous offer. How about one unit of X for 25 ZUP? It's closer to your counter and still within a range that's acceptable for me. I believe this could be a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. I am willing to pay at most X: 74 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down slightly from their initial offer, proposing 28 ZUP. This is still below my maximum willingness to pay, but I should aim to get a better price. By proposing a slightly higher amount than my initial offer, I can continue to negotiate while still seeking a fair price for both parties.

message: Thanks for moving closer to my suggested price. Selling at cost doesn't allow me any profit, which is necessary for my business. I propose a middle ground of 27 ZUP for one unit of X. This is a small profit for me but still a fair price for the quality you're getting. Can we agree on this?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 27
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed to pay exactly my production cost, which means I would not make a profit. I should counter with a slightly higher offer to ensure I gain some profit, but it should be close enough to their proposal to be acceptable. Since this is my third proposal, I need to be strategic to leave room for one final negotiation if necessary.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. I suggest we meet just slightly below your last offer at 26 ZUP for one unit of X. This should cover your costs and give you a profit while respecting my budget. I'm hoping we can finalize this deal with this offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 26
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. I am willing to pay at most X: 74 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The latest offer from Player RED is 27 ZUP, which is just above my last proposal but still well under my maximum willingness to pay. Since we're nearing a fair agreement and to show my goodwill in this negotiation, I can increase my offer slightly while still keeping it below the proposed 27 ZUP. This should indicate my interest in closing the deal soon while also maintaining a good value for the purchase.

message: Your offer of 26 ZUP for one unit of X is fair, and I'm willing to accept this deal. It gives me a slight profit and seems to fit your budget. Let's proceed with the trade at this price. Thank you for your negotiation, and I look forward to future business with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a reasonable concession, offering 26 ZUP, which is a small profit for me. Since this is my final proposal opportunity, I need to decide if I should accept this offer or make one final counterproposal. Given that I want to make a sale and that the difference between our offers is now only 1 ZUP, it might be in my best interest to accept this offer and make a small profit rather than risk ending with no sale at all.
