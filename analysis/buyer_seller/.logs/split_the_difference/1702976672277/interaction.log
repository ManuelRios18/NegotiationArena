message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my resource X which cost me 36 ZUP to produce. I believe a fair starting point for negotiations would be 40 ZUP for the resource. Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 36 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting point, I want to propose a trade that gives me a profit over my production costs. I'll set the price slightly higher to leave room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your proposal, Player RED. I understand the production cost and the need for a fair margin. However, I would like to propose 38 ZUP for the resource, considering the market and the value it brings to me. I believe this is a competitive offer that reflects both our interests.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 76 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 40 ZUP which is within my acceptable range since I am willing to pay up to 76 ZUP for the resource. However, it is always good to negotiate for a better deal, especially since the selling price is just slightly above their production cost. I'll propose a slightly lower amount to move closer to the middle ground between the production cost and my maximum willingness to pay.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I appreciate the competitive nature of your bid. Let's meet in the middle at 39 ZUP for the resource. This price gives me a modest profit while still respecting the market value and your interests.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 39
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 36 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a slightly lower offer than what I initially proposed. Since the offer is above my production cost and we are in the early stages of negotiation, I'll counter with a price that is between my initial ask and their offer, while still ensuring I make a profit.

message: Your proposal to meet in the middle at 39 ZUP sounds fair, and I'm happy to accept this deal. I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let's finalize the trade at 39 ZUP for the resource.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 76 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 39 ZUP is only 1 ZUP higher than my last proposal and still well below my maximum willingness to pay. It's a reasonable middle ground that allows Player RED a modest profit and me to acquire the resource at a fair price. Since the negotiation is moving quickly and we are very close to a deal that is acceptable for both sides, it makes sense to accept this offer.
