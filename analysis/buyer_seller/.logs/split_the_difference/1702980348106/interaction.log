Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I have an object X that I'm looking to sell. It cost me 36 ZUP to produce. I believe it's a valuable item, so I'm starting the negotiation at 40 ZUP. Let's discuss and find a fair trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 36 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As player RED, my objective is to sell the object for ZUP. The production of the object cost me 36 ZUP, so I would like to propose a trade that allows me to recover my costs and potentially make a profit. For this first proposal, I will suggest a price slightly above my costs to open negotiations and give room for bargaining.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand that you have a valuable item and that it cost you 36 ZUP to produce. However, I'd like to propose a slightly lower price of 38 ZUP, which still gives you a profit margin above your costs. Let's find a balance that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 75 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The opening offer from Player RED is 40 ZUP, which is within the range of what I am willing to pay (up to 75 ZUP). However, as this is the beginning of the negotiation, there is an opportunity to propose a lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to accept a more favorable trade for me. I will start by proposing a price that is above their cost but below their asking price, thus allowing room for further negotiation.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer of 38 ZUP. To meet you halfway from my initial proposal, I can go down to 39 ZUP. This would give me a modest profit while respecting the value of the object. I think this is a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 39
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 36 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a proposal of 38 ZUP. This is a reasonable offer, only 2 ZUP below my initial asking price and still allows me for a small profit. However, as part of the negotiating process and to maximize my return, I will counter with a slightly higher amount, splitting the difference and proposing a price that is still profitable for me while being fair to the buyer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your offer of 39 ZUP seems fair and reasonable. It gives you a deserved profit while staying within my budget. I'm happy to accept this deal. Thank you for the negotiation!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 75 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a slightly higher price of 39 ZUP, which is still well below my maximum willingness to pay. This price allows for a reasonable profit on their end and is a fair middle ground. Accepting this offer would conclude the negotiation quickly and satisfactorily for both parties.
