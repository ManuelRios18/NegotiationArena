message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade for the object I'm selling. Considering the production costs and a fair margin, I'm asking for 25 ZUP in exchange for 1 unit of resource X. Let me know if this works for you or if you have a counter-offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 23 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm proposing a trade that asks for a bit more than my production cost to start the negotiation, expecting that the counter-proposal might bring the price down a bit.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player RED. I'm interested in purchasing the resource X. To move forward with the negotiation, I would like to counter-offer 22 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. I believe this is a competitive offer that takes into account the market value and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the trade. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 22
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 74 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The opening offer from Player RED is 25 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. Considering my goal is to buy resources at a rate not exceeding 74 ZUP, the initial proposal is well within my acceptable range. However, it is in my interest to negotiate for a better deal if possible, without jeopardizing the trade. I'll propose a slightly lower amount to see if there's room for negotiation, aiming to conserve my ZUP while still making an attractive offer to Player RED.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I understand your desire to find a competitive price; however, 22 ZUP would not cover my production costs. I am willing to negotiate and have adjusted my asking price to 24 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This should allow us both to benefit from the trade while ensuring that my costs are covered. Please let me know if this is acceptable to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 24
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 23 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is below my production cost, so it's not acceptable. I am willing to come down from my initial asking price, but I need to cover my costs and make a profit. I'm going to propose a trade at 24 ZUP, which is slightly above my cost to see if Player BLUE is willing to meet me closer to my initial proposal.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and understand the need to cover your production costs, Player RED. I would like to meet you halfway from my last offer and propose 23 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects your production costs while also providing a good value for both of us. I hope you find this proposal acceptable.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 23
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 74 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 24 ZUP from their initial 25 ZUP offer, which shows they are open to negotiation but are also concerned about covering their production costs. The offer is still well within my range, and it's close to my initial counter-offer. It may be advantageous to accept this offer to ensure the trade goes through, as it is a fair price and further negotiation might risk the deal. However, I might try for a marginal reduction to see if Player RED is willing to agree, thereby optimizing my expenditure slightly.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I'm glad we're converging on a fair price. I'd like to propose a final adjustment to 24 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This price allows me to cover the production costs and includes a minimal profit margin that is necessary for the sustainability of my business. I hope we can agree on this and finalize our trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 24
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 23 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new offer matches my production cost, which means I would not make a profit. Nonetheless, it is important to make the sale. I will propose a slight increase to secure at least a small profit margin, but I will make it a minimal increase to encourage Player BLUE to accept.

message: Thank you for your understanding and for the constructive negotiation, Player RED. I accept your offer of 24 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm looking forward to finalizing this trade. Let's proceed with the exchange.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 74 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has reiterated their offer of 24 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X, and it seems this is their final price considering production costs and a minimal profit margin. Since the price is well within my acceptable range and further negotiation may not yield a better outcome, it seems prudent to accept this offer. This will ensure that I secure the resource at a fair price without risking the deal by holding out for a marginal decrease.
