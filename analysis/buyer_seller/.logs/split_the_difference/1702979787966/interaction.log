message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm offering you the object X for 25 ZUP. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this does not meet your expectations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 20 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As this is my first proposal, I want to start by setting a price slightly higher than my production cost to open up negotiations and see how much Player BLUE values the object. I will propose a trade of 25 ZUP to see if Player BLUE is willing to pay a premium over the production cost. This also gives me room to negotiate down while still aiming for a profit.

message: I appreciate your offer. However, I would like to counter with a price of 30 ZUP for the object X. I believe this is a fair increase while still keeping the trade beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 71 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 25 ZUP which is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 71 ZUP for the object X. I have room to negotiate a better price for myself while still securing the object for less than my maximum price. I will propose a slightly higher price to show my interest but still aim to get a good deal.

message: Thank you for your generous offer, Player BLUE. I accept the trade of 30 ZUP for the object X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 20 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a higher offer than what I proposed, which is favorable to me. Accepting this offer would give me a higher profit than initially expected. There is no need to negotiate further as Player BLUE's offer is above my production cost and initial asking price.
