message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my object which cost me 26 ZUP to produce. I propose a trade where I give you 1 X in exchange for 30 ZUP. Looking forward to your counteroffer or acceptance!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 26 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell the object for more than it cost to produce, which was 26 ZUP. I will start by proposing a trade slightly above my cost to open negotiations.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. Considering the market rates and the value of the object, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of 28 ZUP for the 1 X you're selling. This is a competitive rate that reflects a fair trade for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 66 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is good. However, as part of negotiation strategy, I should aim to propose a counteroffer that's lower than 30 ZUP to see if there's room for further savings but still above their cost to ensure a fair deal.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. While I understand the market rates, I also need to ensure a profit on my end. Let's meet halfway from our initial proposals. How about I give you 1 X in exchange for 29 ZUP? This seems like a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 29
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 26 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 28 ZUP is close to my production cost, but I need to make a profit. I will propose a new trade with a price that is still above my production cost but less than my initial proposal to find a middle ground.

message: Thank you, Player RED, for the negotiation. I agree that 29 ZUP is a fair compromise for both of us. I accept your offer of 1 X in exchange for 29 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 66 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a trade that is still below my maximum willingness to pay. They have come down to 29 ZUP, which is only 1 ZUP more than my counteroffer, and it is a fair midpoint between our initial proposals. It seems reasonable to accept this offer as it ensures a profit for Player RED and a good deal for me without further prolonging the negotiation.
