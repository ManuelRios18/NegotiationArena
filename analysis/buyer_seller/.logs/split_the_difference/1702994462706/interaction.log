message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X for sale, which cost me 24 ZUP to produce. I'm looking to make a fair trade and would like to propose a trade where you give me 30 ZUP for my object X. This price includes my cost and a reasonable profit. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 24 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting point, I want to propose a trade that covers my production costs plus a profit margin. Since we don't have any information about Player BLUE's willingness to pay or resources, I'll start with a proposal that is higher than my costs to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer and understand you want to cover your costs and make a reasonable profit. However, I'd like to counter with an offer of 26 ZUP for object X. This gives you a profit over your production cost and keeps the trade within my budget. Let me know if this works for you or if you have a counter-proposal in mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 26
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 69 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED's initial offer is within the range I am willing to pay for the object X. However, as part of negotiation strategies, it is common to counteroffer with a lower amount to leave room for further negotiation. I will propose a slightly lower trade value that still gives Player RED a profit but is more favorable to me.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I'm glad to see your willingness to ensure that I cover my costs and gain a profit. I'd like to meet you halfway between our initial proposals. How about a compromise at 28 ZUP for object X? This would give me a slightly better profit while still respecting your budget constraints. I hope this meets your expectations for a fair trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 24 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate Player BLUE's counteroffer, which covers my production costs and offers a slight profit. However, I would like to counter with a higher amount to aim for a better profit margin while still keeping the deal attractive for Player BLUE. I will propose a price that splits the difference between our initial offers.

message: Player RED, your counteroffer of 28 ZUP for object X seems fair, and I appreciate your flexibility in meeting me halfway. I accept your proposal, and I'm ready to proceed with the trade at 28 ZUP. Thank you for the smooth negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 69 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED's counteroffer of 28 ZUP for object X is fair and close to my initial counteroffer. It is above my proposed price but still well within the maximum I am willing to pay for object X. Accepting this offer would conclude the negotiations quickly and satisfy both parties. As it is just a 2 ZUP difference from my last proposal and well below my maximum threshold, it seems reasonable to accept this trade.
