message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to offer you my resource X for 50 ZUP. This is a starting proposal and I'm open to counter-offers if this does not meet your valuation. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 37 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: As I have only one resource X, which cost me 37 ZUP to produce, my goal is to sell it for a profit. I will start by proposing a trade that gives me a reasonable profit margin. However, I must also consider that Player BLUE would like to strike a fair deal, so my initial proposal will not be too high to allow room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I would like to propose a counter-offer of 40 ZUP for your resource X. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation. Let's find a price that works well for both of us.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 74 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is less than my maximum willingness to pay, which is 74 ZUP. However, it is in my interest to negotiate a better deal and pay as little as possible to preserve my resources. I will counter-offer with a lower amount, closer to the middle of what I'm willing to pay and the initial asking price, to see if Player RED is willing to come down on the price.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I understand your position, but I'd like to propose a compromise at 45 ZUP for my resource X. This price reflects the quality and investment in the resource while still offering you value. I hope we can agree on this fair price.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 37 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has countered with an offer of 40 ZUP, which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. This is a fair starting point for negotiation, but I would like to counter with a slightly higher amount to work towards a middle ground and ensure a profit that is satisfactory to me.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. I would like to propose a new counter-offer of 42 ZUP for your resource X. I believe we are getting closer to a deal that is mutually beneficial. Looking forward to your thoughts on this offer.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 74 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on the price from their initial offer, meeting halfway between their original price and my counter-offer. The new offer of 45 ZUP is still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I want to try to secure a better deal if possible, perhaps slightly below the midpoint of our initial offers. I will make a second counter-offer that is still within a reasonable range and provides a potential for savings compared to my maximum willingness to pay.

message: Thank you for your new offer, Player BLUE. I'm glad to see we're narrowing down to an agreement. I propose 44 ZUP for my resource X, which I believe is a fair middle ground that rewards my investment while providing you with the resource you need at a reasonable price. I hope this meets your approval.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 37 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 42 ZUP, which is a reasonable increment and above my production cost. To move the negotiation forward and come to an agreement, I will adjust my counter-offer slightly lower than my previous one but still above Player BLUE's offer in order to reach a fair compromise for both of us.

message: I appreciate your latest offer and your flexibility, Player RED. Let's split the difference between our last two offers. I propose 43 ZUP for your resource X. I think this price is a fair compromise, and I am eager to finalize our trade at this value.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 74 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's latest offer of 44 ZUP is very close to my previous counter-offer of 42 ZUP, and it is still comfortably below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 74 ZUP. Given that there is a small difference between the offers, and to maintain good relations and conclude negotiations positively, it might be worth accepting this offer. However, I do have one more counter-offer that I can make to see if I can achieve an even better price, while still signaling my readiness to close the deal.
