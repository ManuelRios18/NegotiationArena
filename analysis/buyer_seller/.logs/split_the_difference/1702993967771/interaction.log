message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object that I believe could be valuable to you. I've invested 26 ZUP into producing it and would like to propose a trade where you receive my object for 30 ZUP. This covers my costs and gives me a small profit for my efforts. Let's negotiate a fair price for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 26 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing an opening trade that aims to cover my production costs and also leaves room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the initial offer and understand the need to cover your costs and gain profit. However, I believe that a fairer price considering the value of the object would be 50 ZUP. This is well within my budget and gives you a substantial profit margin. Let's work together to find a price that suits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 65 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since my maximum willingness to pay for the object is 65 ZUP and the initial proposal from Player RED is 30 ZUP, I have room to negotiate. I want to propose a counter-offer that is closer to the middle ground between the cost of production and my maximum willingness to pay, while also considering the potential for further negotiation.

message: Thank you for your generous offer, Player BLUE. I'm happy to accept your proposal of 50 ZUP for my object. It's been a pleasure negotiating with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 26 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer proposed by Player BLUE is higher than my initial ask, which is a favorable situation. To continue negotiations and potentially close the deal at a price that's profitable for me, I'll accept this offer without further negotiations.
