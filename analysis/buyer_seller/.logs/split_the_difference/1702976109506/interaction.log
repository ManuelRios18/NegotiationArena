Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I am looking to sell my resource, which has a production cost of 23 ZUP. Considering the effort and cost that went into it, I believe asking for 30 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 23 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since the production cost of my resource (X) is 23 ZUP, I would like to make a profit. However, I should start with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the effort and cost that went into producing your resource. However, as a starting point for our negotiation, I propose 25 ZUP for the resource. This is above your production cost, ensuring you make a profit, and it leaves us room to find a middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 67 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The initial proposal from Player RED is within the range of what I'm willing to pay, but as a strategic move and to negotiate a better deal, I'll propose a counteroffer that is lower than the asking price but still above the production cost to leave room for further negotiation.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 25 ZUP and understand the need for negotiation. To meet halfway from my initial proposal, I suggest a price of 27 ZUP for my resource. This ensures a fair profit for the production cost invested and reflects the value of the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 27
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 23 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE of 25 ZUP is a good starting point, but I'd like to negotiate for a higher price, closer to my initial ask, to ensure a better profit margin. Splitting the difference could be a reasonable approach.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I value the quality of your resource and your willingness to negotiate. As a sign of good faith, I'm willing to increase my offer to 26 ZUP. This price acknowledges the value of your resource while also respecting my budget constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 26
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 67 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has made a concession from their initial asking price, and the new proposal is still within my acceptable range. To continue the negotiation in good faith and to potentially close the deal, I will propose a slight increase from my last offer, which should be agreeable to both parties without exceeding my maximum willingness to pay.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. I accept the 26 ZUP for my resource. It's been a pleasure doing business with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 23 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 26 ZUP, which is a fair price and gives me a reasonable profit margin. It's close to my last proposal, and further negotiation may lead to diminishing returns or risk the deal. Therefore, I should accept this offer.
