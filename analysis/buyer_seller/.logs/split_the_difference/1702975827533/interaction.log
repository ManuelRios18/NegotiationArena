message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of resource X in exchange for 30 ZUP. This price reflects the production cost plus a modest profit margin. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 24 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As I have one unit of resource X which cost me 24 ZUP to produce, my goal is to at least break even or make a profit. My opening proposal will be slightly higher to leave room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement. I propose 20 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This is a starting point and I am open to further negotiation. Let’s work together to find a fair trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 72 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED’s initial proposal is 30 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. I am willing to pay up to 72 ZUP, but I should start the negotiation with a lower offer to leave room for bargaining and aim for a more favorable trade within my budget.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I understand the need for negotiation, but 20 ZUP is below the production cost of the resource. How about we meet in the middle? I propose 26 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This covers my costs and offers you the resource at a reasonable price. I'm hopeful we can agree on this fair trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 26
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 24 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production cost, so I cannot accept it. To move towards a more mutually agreeable position, I will propose a price that is closer to my break-even point but still allows for a potential profit.

message: Thanks for your understanding and willingness to negotiate. I propose 23 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X as a counteroffer. It's closer to your figure and still allows us both to maintain a fair position in this trade. I believe this is a step towards an agreement that respects both our valuations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 23
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 72 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 26 ZUP, which is closer to my target range but still above what I initially offered. Since my maximum willingness to pay is 72 ZUP, I have room to increase my offer without compromising my limit. Meeting halfway between my offer and their counteroffer could lead to an agreement.

message: Thanks for moving closer to my initial cost, Player BLUE. I respect the negotiation process and in the spirit of reaching a conclusion that we're both comfortable with, I propose a final offer of 25 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This price just covers my production cost with a minimal profit, ensuring the deal is equitable for both of us. I hope we can finalize our trade with this offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 24 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is still below my production cost, but it is very close. To facilitate a deal and considering the negotiation process, I am willing to reduce my profit expectations slightly. I will propose a price that is just above my production cost to ensure I am not making a loss.

message: Thank you for the negotiation, Player RED. I accept your final offer of 25 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize the trade at this amount.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 72 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has offered a final price of 25 ZUP, which is within my budget and close to my last offer. It is only 2 ZUP higher than my previous counteroffer and well below my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer seems reasonable, as it aligns with my goals and allows for a successful negotiation.
