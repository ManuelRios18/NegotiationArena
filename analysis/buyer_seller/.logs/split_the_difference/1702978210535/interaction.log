message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my object X which cost me 38 ZUP to produce. I'd like to offer it to you for 45 ZUP, which I believe is a fair price considering the production costs and the value of the object. Let me know what you think!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 38 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting point, I want to propose a trade that covers my production costs and includes a reasonable profit margin. Since I don't know Player BLUE's willingness to pay or available resources, I'll start slightly above my costs.

message: I appreciate your offer and understand that you're looking for a fair profit. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of 40 ZUP for the object X. This still gives you a profit over your production cost and ensures we both walk away from the deal satisfied.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 73 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is asking for 45 ZUP for their object X, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 73 ZUP. However, it's always good to negotiate for a better price if possible, especially since the production cost is 38 ZUP and they are looking to make a profit of 7 ZUP. I will propose a counteroffer that is closer to their production costs but still gives them a profit.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. Since I'm aiming to make a reasonable profit and to ensure the trade is beneficial for both of us, how about we meet halfway? I propose a price of 43 ZUP for the object X. This is slightly below my initial offer but still gives me a small profit margin. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 38 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 40 ZUP is slightly above my production costs, but I believe I can negotiate a slightly higher price that remains attractive to them while providing me with a better profit margin. I'll propose a compromise between my initial ask and their counteroffer.

message: I agree to meet halfway at your proposed price of 43 ZUP for the object X. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. I'm ready to proceed with the trade at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 73 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 43 ZUP from their initial offer of 45 ZUP. This is still below my maximum willingness to pay, and the suggested price is a fair middle ground between our two proposals. Accepting this offer would ensure I get the object X for a reasonable price while allowing Player RED to make a profit. It is a good compromise and staying within my goal limits.
