message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my object X, which has cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm proposing a starting trade where I give you 1 X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This would ensure I recoup my production costs and make a profit. I'm open to hearing your counteroffer if this doesn't work for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I want to sell my resource for ZUP and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, my initial proposal will be slightly above my costs to ensure a profit. However, I must also be willing to negotiate with Player BLUE to reach an agreement.

message: Thank you for your offer! Since I am looking to get the best deal possible, I would like to counterpropose with 48 ZUP for 1 X. This is slightly below your asking price but should still provide you with a decent profit margin. I believe this is a fair trade for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 75 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since my goal is to pay no more than 75 ZUP and Player RED's initial offer is below my maximum willingness to pay, I'm inclined to accept the offer. However, I could propose a slightly lower amount to see if I can save some ZUP while still making a deal that Player RED might accept. To maintain good negotiating relations, I will propose a price that is close to their asking price.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 48 ZUP for my 1 X. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To meet in the middle and to facilitate a deal that benefits both of us, I propose 49 ZUP for 1 X. This is just a bit above your last offer and still ensures a reasonable profit for both parties. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 49
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 48 ZUP for my X. This is below my initial asking price but still offers me a profit above my production costs. I want to negotiate to see if I can get a slightly better deal, perhaps meeting halfway between my initial ask and their counteroffer.

message: I accept your offer of 49 ZUP for 1 X. It's a fair compromise, and I'm happy we could come to an agreement that benefits both of us. Looking forward to finalizing this deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 75 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new offer of 49 ZUP is still below my maximum threshold of 75 ZUP. The difference between our proposals is minimal, and accepting this offer would lead to a successful negotiation while still staying within my budget. Accepting this offer seems like a reasonable and efficient conclusion to the negotiations.
