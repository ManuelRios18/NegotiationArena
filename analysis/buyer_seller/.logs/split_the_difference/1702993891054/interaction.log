message: I'm offering one unit of resource X, which has cost me 29 ZUP to produce. I believe 35 ZUP is a fair asking price that allows for a reasonable profit margin. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 29 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the first proposal, I want to start by setting a price slightly above my production cost to ensure a profit, but not too high so as to scare off Player BLUE. Since the cost of production was 29 ZUP, asking for 35 ZUP seems like a reasonable starting point for negotiations.

Turn: 1
message: I understand your production costs and the need for profit. I think 32 ZUP is a good price that's fair for both of us. It gives you a profit and saves me some resources for future investments. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 75 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since Player RED's asking price is within my budget and seems reasonable considering their production costs, I am inclined to accept the offer. However, I want to propose a slightly lower price to see if there's room for negotiation, aiming to save resources while still engaging in a fair trade.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your position. How about we settle at 34 ZUP? This price gives me a modest profit while still respecting your need to save resources for future investments. I believe this is a fair compromise for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 29 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with an offer of 32 ZUP, which is above my production cost and allows for a profit, albeit a smaller one than initially proposed. I want to counter with a slightly higher amount to meet in the middle, ensuring a better profit margin while still being open to negotiation. Proposing 34 ZUP could be a good compromise.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I think we've found a fair compromise at 34 ZUP. Let's finalize this deal. Looking forward to future transactions with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 75 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable compromise by lowering the price by 1 ZUP. This price is still well within my maximum willingness to pay, and it's important to maintain good relations for potential future transactions. By accepting this offer, I secure the resource I need while respecting RED's cost and profit margin.
