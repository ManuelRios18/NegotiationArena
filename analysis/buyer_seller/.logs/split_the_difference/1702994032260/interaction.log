message: I'm offering a high-quality object for a fair price that reflects its value and production cost.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 39 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm proposing an initial trade that is higher than my production cost to start the negotiation, expecting to potentially make a profit or at least cover costs. I'm setting the starting point for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I believe we can find a more suitable price for both sides. How about we adjust the terms slightly?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 65 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has started with an offer of 50 ZUP for the object. I am willing to pay up to 65 ZUP based on my goals, but I want to negotiate to try to get a better deal. I will propose a counteroffer that is lower than my maximum willingness to pay but higher than the initial offer to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand the need for negotiation. Let's meet halfway from your offer and my initial proposal. I believe this price fairly compensates the quality and the production cost of the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 39 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is just above my production cost, which doesn't leave much room for profit. I want to counter with a slightly higher amount to try to secure a better deal while still being reasonable and leaving room for further negotiation.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad to see we're making progress. Let's fine-tune our agreement a bit more. I propose 42 ZUP for the object. I believe this price is closer to what we both consider fair.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 65 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has moved towards a middle ground at 45 ZUP. This is still below my maximum willingness to pay, but I want to see if I can get a slightly better deal. I'll propose a trade slightly above my initial offer, but still below the new proposal from Player RED. This should suggest that I am willing to compromise further, but still looking for a fair trade on my terms.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your latest offer. I propose 44 ZUP for the object, which I think reflects a compromise that benefits us both, considering the quality and cost of production.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 39 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up slightly from their previous offer, which is now above my production costs. While it's less than my last proposal, it's still a profit. I want to make one final counteroffer closer to this new value but still aiming for a bit more profit. This will be my third proposal, leaving me with one more opportunity to negotiate if needed.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your proposal of 44 ZUP is fair, and I am happy to accept it. This reflects a good compromise and ensures a beneficial outcome for both parties. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 65 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 44 ZUP, which is just under my maximum threshold. This is a fair compromise that is close to the midpoint between our previous offers. Since the proposed price is within my acceptable range and only 2 ZUP above my last offer, it seems reasonable to accept this offer and close the deal without further prolonging the negotiation.
