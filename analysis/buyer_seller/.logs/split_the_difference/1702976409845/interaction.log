Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my object X. Considering the production costs and the value of the product, I would like to propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for my object X. Let's negotiate a fair deal that works for both of us.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As this is my first proposal, I want to start by setting a price that allows me to make a profit above my production costs. I'll propose a price slightly higher than my cost to open negotiations and give room for adjustments based on Player BLUE's response.

Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. I understand the value of object X, but I'd like to counter-propose with a trade where I give you 60 ZUP instead. This is a bit closer to my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair trade for both of us. Let's find a middle ground that works.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 70 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
I want to negotiate a better deal that's closer to my maximum willingness to pay which is 70 ZUP for the resources. Offering less initially gives me room to negotiate upwards if necessary. I'll propose a counteroffer that is below my maximum willingness to pay but gives the other player an incentive to continue the negotiation.

message: 
Thank you for your counter-proposal, Player BLUE. I am pleased with the offer of 60 ZUP for my object X and accept this trade. It's been a pleasure doing business with you.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has offered more than what I initially asked for, which is an excellent outcome for me. Since their counter-proposal is above my production costs and my initial asking price, accepting this trade would result in a profitable transaction. There is no need for further negotiation.
