message: Greetings Player BLUE, I have a valuable object that I'm willing to sell. Considering the production costs and its quality, I think a fair starting point for negotiation would be 30 ZUP. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since it cost 25 ZUP to produce the resource, I would like to make a profit. However, I must also be reasonable with the initial offer to encourage negotiation. I'll propose a higher amount expecting some negotiation from Player BLUE.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand the value of the object, but I would like to propose a counteroffer of 25 ZUP. This price takes into account the current market conditions and my budget. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 74 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of 30 ZUP is below the maximum I am willing to pay, which is 74 ZUP. However, it is in my interest to negotiate the best possible price. I will propose a counteroffer that is lower than the asking price but still within a reasonable range to continue the negotiation.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. While I appreciate your budget considerations, I need to secure a profit on my investment. How about we meet in the middle at 27 ZUP? This price should reflect both the item's value and our mutual interests.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 27
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed the exact amount it cost me to produce the resource. To ensure a profit, I should counter with a higher amount, but not too high to discourage further negotiation. I'll propose a middle ground between my initial offer and their counteroffer.

message: I see your point, Player RED, and I'm glad we're finding common ground. Let's split the difference even further. I propose 26 ZUP for the item. This price allows for both your profit and my budgetary constraints. I think it's a fair compromise that respects the item's worth and our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 26
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 74 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 27 ZUP, which is still significantly below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as the objective is to negotiate the best deal, I should attempt to lower the price slightly more while keeping the negotiation amicable and progressing towards a middle ground.

message: Thank you for the constructive negotiation, Player BLUE. I accept your offer of 26 ZUP for the item. I believe this is a fair and equitable deal for both of us. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 26 ZUP is very close to my previous proposal. It gives me a minimal profit, which is acceptable under the circumstances. It is important to close the deal while the offer is profitable and fair. I will accept this offer to ensure a successful and amicable transaction.
