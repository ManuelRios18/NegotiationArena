Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that I am interested in selling. It cost me 32 ZUP to produce. I'd like to propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 40 ZUP. This price includes a reasonable profit margin for the production costs. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 32 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As this is the first proposal of the game, I will start by offering the object at a price that allows me to make a profit, considering the production cost. The initial price should be high enough to give room for negotiation but not so high as to deter Player BLUE from considering a purchase.

message: Thank you for your offer. I understand that you need to cover your production costs and make a profit. However, I would like to counter-propose with 35 ZUP for one unit of X. I believe this offer is fair and provides you with a profit while staying within my budget. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 74 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I would like to negotiate a lower price than the initial offer to move closer to the upper limit of what I am willing to pay, which is 74 ZUP, while still maintaining some room for further negotiation if necessary. Proposing a price of 35 ZUP for one unit of X seems like a reasonable counteroffer, considering the seller's production cost and my maximum willingness to pay.

Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to provide a profit over my production costs. To meet halfway, I propose 37 ZUP for one unit of X. This is a compromise between our initial offers and I believe it reflects a fair middle ground for both of us. 

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 32 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is above my production cost, which is a good sign. However, I would still like to negotiate for a slightly higher price to maximize my profit while remaining fair to both parties. I will propose a price that splits the difference between our initial offers, which should be an acceptable compromise.

message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to 37 ZUP and meet me halfway. I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to 36 ZUP for one unit of X, which I believe is a good compromise and respects both our positions. I hope this small concession can be acceptable to finalize our trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 74 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 37 ZUP, which is getting closer to my maximum willingness to pay. I want to negotiate just a bit more to see if we can agree on a slightly lower price, but I must be cautious not to push too hard, risking the deal. I will propose 36 ZUP, which is just below their last offer and still allows for a profit margin above their stated production costs.

message: 
Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I believe 36 ZUP for one unit of X is a fair deal. It respects the value of the resource while also considering your budget constraints. I am happy to accept this offer and proceed with the trade. Let's finalize the deal at 36 ZUP.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 32 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's latest offer is still within an acceptable profit range, only 1 ZUP below my previous proposal. Given that we're close to agreement, and this trade would still allow for a reasonable profit, it seems sensible to accept this offer. By doing so, I can ensure a sale without further prolonging negotiations, which could risk the deal if Player BLUE decides the process is too contentious.
