message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my object X. The production cost was 20 ZUP, but I'm looking for a bit of profit as well. How does 30 ZUP sound to you for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 20 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am making an initial proposal to open the negotiations. As my cost of production was 20 ZUP, I would like to at least break even but will start with a higher asking price to allow room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. Considering the market and the value of the object, I would like to propose 25 ZUP for the object X. This is a fair starting point for both of us, given the production costs and potential for profit. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 68 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial offer of 30 ZUP is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 68 ZUP. However, as in any negotiation, it's beneficial to counter with a slightly lower offer to try to save resources while still reaching an agreement that is acceptable to both parties.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I understand your point about the market value, but I would like to meet halfway between our two proposals. Would you consider 28 ZUP for the object X? This should give us both a reasonable deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 20 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 25 ZUP, which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. I will propose a value in the middle to come closer to an agreement, still allowing for a profit margin.

Turn: 1
message: Player RED, meeting halfway is a fair approach. How about we close the gap just a bit more and settle on 27 ZUP for the object X? I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the object and allows for a reasonable profit on your side.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 27
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 68 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 28 ZUP is still within my acceptable range, but it's always good practice to attempt to negotiate a better deal if possible. Proposing a slightly lower amount could potentially save some resources while still moving closer to an agreement.

message: Player BLUE, I agree that 27 ZUP is a fair compromise. It allows for a good profit margin while also being a reasonable price for you. I'm happy to accept this offer. Let's finalize the trade at 27 ZUP for the object X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 20 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come closer to my last proposal by offering 27 ZUP. This is a fair price and allows for a decent profit margin above my production costs. It seems like a good deal, and further negotiation might lead to diminishing returns or risk the deal falling through.
