message: Hello, Player BLUE. I have a high-quality object that cost me 22 ZUP to produce. I propose to trade it for 25 ZUP, giving you the opportunity to acquire a valuable resource while allowing me to make a small profit. Looking forward to your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 22 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the first proposal, I want to start by setting a price that allows me to recover the production costs and make a profit. I'll set the initial asking price slightly above my costs to leave room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand you're looking to make a profit, and I'm interested in acquiring the resource. However, I would like to propose a trade closer to your cost of production. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 22
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 80 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The current proposal from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 80 ZUP. However, it is in my interest to negotiate the best possible deal. I will propose a counteroffer that is closer to the production cost to see if there is room for negotiation, while still ensuring Player RED makes a profit.

message: Thank you for your response, Player BLUE. While I appreciate your offer, I must consider the effort and cost that went into producing the resource. To move forward, I propose a trade for 24 ZUP, which represents a fair compromise allowing for a modest profit on my end. I hope this meets your approval and we can come to a mutual agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 24
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 22 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate Player BLUE's willingness to engage in negotiations. They are offering to cover my cost, but as a business, I aim to make a profit. I will propose a price slightly lower than my initial ask to show my willingness to negotiate but still aim for a profit margin.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. I understand the need for profit, so I am prepared to offer a slightly higher amount than my initial proposal. Let's settle at 23 ZUP for the resource, which still gives you a profit and is a reasonable price for me. I believe this is moving towards a fair middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 23
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 80 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down by 1 ZUP from their initial proposal, which suggests a willingness to negotiate but still aims for a profit above the production cost. Since my maximum willingness to pay is 80 ZUP and we are far from that, I have room to increase my offer slightly to show flexibility while still seeking a better deal.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I believe 23 ZUP is a fair price that allows me to gain a profit while also being reasonable for you. I accept your offer. Let's proceed with the trade at 23 ZUP for the resource.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 22 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up from their initial offer, showing a good faith effort to find a middle ground. They are now offering 23 ZUP, which is a reasonable compromise and gives me a small profit. Since I want to close the deal and it's essential to maintain good business relations, I think accepting this offer would be a wise decision.
