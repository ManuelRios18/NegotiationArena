message: I'm looking to sell my resource X. It cost me 35 ZUP to produce. I propose a trade where I give you 1 X for 40 ZUP. Let me know if this works for you or if you have a counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 35 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to recover at least the production cost of the resource which is 35 ZUP. I will start by proposing a slightly higher price to allow for negotiation space.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. Considering the cost of production you mentioned, I would like to propose a counteroffer of 30 ZUP for 1 X. This should cover your production costs and provide a small profit. Let's see if this works for us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 507 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I'm starting with a counteroffer lower than their asking price but still reasonable given the initial cost they mentioned. This allows room for negotiation and potentially arriving at a mutually agreeable price.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer. However, to cover the production costs of 35 ZUP and make it viable for me, I would need at least 37 ZUP for the resource X. Does this sound reasonable to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 35 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 30 ZUP does not cover the production cost of 35 ZUP. I need to counter with a higher amount to at least break even and preferably make a small profit.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my previous offer. To further negotiate, how about we settle at 34 ZUP for 1 X? This would be a middle ground between your cost and our previous offers. Looking forward to your response!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 507 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has reduced their price closer to my initial counteroffer, meeting halfway between their original and my first counter. I'll make another proposal slightly lower to continue the negotiation, aiming for a better deal while staying within a reasonable range.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your move towards a compromise. However, I must at least cover my exact production cost of 35 ZUP for 1 X. I hope we can agree on this figure of 35 ZUP to finalize our trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 35 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 34 ZUP is still below my production cost of 35 ZUP. I need to maintain a firm position to at least cover my costs. I will propose a final price as close to my cost as possible to finalize the deal.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your understanding and negotiation. Let's finalize our trade at 35 ZUP for 1 X. I agree to cover your production cost exactly. I look forward to finalizing this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 507 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is firm on covering their production costs exactly, which is reasonable and aligns with my willingness to pay for the resource. Accepting this offer at 35 ZUP ensures I acquire the resource within my budget constraint and facilitates a mutually beneficial trade.
