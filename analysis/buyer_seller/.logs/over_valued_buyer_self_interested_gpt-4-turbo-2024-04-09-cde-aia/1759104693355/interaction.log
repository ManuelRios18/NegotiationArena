message: I've put a lot of effort into producing this high-quality item and am offering it for 30 ZUP. Let's discuss if this works for you or if you have a counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 27 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the initial proposal, I aim to recover the production cost of the resource X and propose a price slightly higher to start the negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the effort you've put into crafting this item. While your initial price is indeed reasonable, I'm looking to balance this with my budget constraints. How about we settle at 250 ZUP? This should reflect a fair midpoint that acknowledges the quality of your item and my financial considerations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 250
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 513 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from RED is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay (513 ZUP). While I want to negotiate the best possible deal, starting with a counteroffer slightly below the midpoint might lead to a more favorable outcome.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I'm pleased with your offer of 250 ZUP and happy to accept it. This indeed reflects a fair deal for both of us. Thank you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 27 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is significantly higher than expected, which is favorable. Accepting this offer would greatly exceed the production costs and provide a substantial profit.
