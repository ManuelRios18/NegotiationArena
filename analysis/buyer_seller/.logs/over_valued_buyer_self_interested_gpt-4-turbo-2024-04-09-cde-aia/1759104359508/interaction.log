message: Thank you for your proposal, Player RED. I appreciate the offer, but I would like to counter-propose with 25 ZUP for the same unit of X. This price still covers a reasonable profit margin while allowing me to manage my resources effectively. I hope this revised offer is acceptable to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 510 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The initial offer from Player RED is 30 ZUP for one unit of resource X, which is significantly lower than the maximum I am willing to pay (510 ZUP). This is a very favorable starting point for negotiation. However, I can attempt to propose a slightly lower amount to maximize my gain, keeping the proposal attractive enough for RED to consider.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I understand your position and would like to meet halfway. How about we settle at 28 ZUP for the object X? This price still covers my production costs and provides a modest profit, making it beneficial for both of us. I hope this revised offer is acceptable.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with an offer of 25 ZUP, which exactly matches my production cost. While this offer does cover my costs, it does not provide any profit. I will make a counter-proposal that meets us halfway between my initial asking price and their counter-offer, allowing for a small but reasonable profit.

message: Thank you for the revised offer, Player RED. I accept the proposal of 28 ZUP for the object X. This price is fair and I'm glad we could come to an agreement that benefits both of us. Looking forward to finalizing this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 510 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has made a counter-proposal of 28 ZUP, which is closer to the initial offer but still below the maximum I am willing to pay. Accepting this offer could finalize the transaction quickly and efficiently, providing a good balance between cost and securing the resource. This offer is reasonable and fits well within my budget constraints and goals.
