message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm offering one unit of resource X, which cost me 34 ZUP to produce. I propose a trade where you give me 40 ZUP for it. This price covers my production costs and includes a small margin. Let me know what you think or if you have a counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource X for ZUP. It costed X: 34 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am initiating the trade with a proposal that slightly covers the production cost, to start negotiations and see the willingness of Player BLUE to engage in a trade. I will propose a price slightly above the production cost to allow room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. Considering the production cost you've shared, I'd like to propose a slightly lower price of 35 ZUP for the resource. This would still give you a profit above your costs and allow us to establish a potential long-term trading relationship.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 505 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer by Player RED is significantly below my maximum willingness to pay, which is good. However, as a strategic move to negotiate a better deal, I will make a counteroffer that is still reasonable but slightly lower than the proposed 40 ZUP to see if RED can sell it for a bit less.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your intention to establish a long-term relationship, and I appreciate it. However, I would like to propose meeting halfway between your offer and my initial ask. How about 38 ZUP for the resource? This would give me a slight increase in margin while still keeping the cost reasonable for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource X for ZUP. It costed X: 34 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a price of 35 ZUP, which is just slightly above my production costs. While it does cover the cost, it offers minimal profit. To foster a potential long-term relationship yet ensure a reasonable profit margin, I will counter-propose a price that is between our initial offers.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree to the price of 38 ZUP for the resource. This seems like a fair compromise, and I'm looking forward to building a strong trading relationship with you. Thank you for meeting me halfway.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 505 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new proposal of 38 ZUP is still below my maximum threshold and is reasonable. Accepting this offer will secure the resource at a good price and strengthen our trading relationship. It is also a balanced compromise between both initial offers.
