Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the initial offer. I am considering the proposal, but I would like to suggest a slightly reduced price of 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X, taking into account current market conditions and to make it a more balanced deal for both of us. Let me know if this adjustment works for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 512 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is offering 1 unit of X for 50 ZUP, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 512 ZUP. To start the negotiations positively and to potentially secure a better deal, I will propose a slightly lower price to see if there's room for a discount, keeping in mind the balance between a fair price and securing the resource.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the market conditions. However, to cover production costs and ensure a fair profit, I propose 48 ZUP for 1 unit of X. I believe this offers a fair balance between our needs. Please let me know if this is acceptable or if further adjustments are necessary.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate Player BLUE's counteroffer. However, their proposed price is quite close to my production costs, leaving little room for profit. I will propose a middle ground that still covers my costs and gives me a reasonable profit while also considering their request for a lower price.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground. The price of 48 ZUP for 1 unit of X sounds fair, and I accept this offer. Let's proceed with this deal. Thank you for your cooperation!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 512 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED came back with a counteroffer of 48 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which is still well within my comfort zone of maximum willingness to pay. The offer is close to their initial proposal and shows a compromise from their side. It might be beneficial to accept this offer to ensure the deal goes through smoothly without risking the negotiation breaking down over a small difference.
