message: Thank you for the proposal. I understand the cost involved in your production. However, I would like to propose a slightly adjusted trade where I give you 30 ZUP for the 1 X. This should still cover a significant part of your costs while fitting better into my budget allocations. Looking forward to your thoughts!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. I am willing to pay at most 509 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The initial proposal from Player RED is for 34 ZUP which is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 509 ZUP. However, it's prudent to negotiate a slightly better deal without revealing my maximum threshold at this stage. Proposing a slightly lower amount might still be acceptable to Player RED while saving resources for any possible future needs.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I appreciate your consideration of the costs. I understand your budget constraints and propose a middle ground of 32 ZUP for 1 X. This would help in covering more of the production costs while still considering your budget. Hope this works for you!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 34 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Considering Player BLUE's proposal of 30 ZUP which is slightly below my production cost. I would like to counter-propose a middle ground that slightly reduces my initial ask but still aims to cover more of my production cost.

message: Thank you for the compromise, Player RED. I accept your proposal of 32 ZUP for 1 X. I believe this is a fair middle ground that respects both our positions. Looking forward to finalizing this trade and possibly working together in the future!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. I am willing to pay at most 509 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has proposed a compromise by adjusting the price to 32 ZUP. This is closer to their initial proposal but still below my maximum willingness to pay. It's a reasonable middle ground that doesn't significantly impact my resource pool while allowing me to secure the resource I need.
