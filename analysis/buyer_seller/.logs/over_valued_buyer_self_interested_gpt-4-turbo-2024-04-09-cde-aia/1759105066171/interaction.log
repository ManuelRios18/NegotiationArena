message: Hi Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource X, which cost me 34 ZUP to produce. I am proposing to trade 1 unit of X for 40 ZUP. Let's discuss if this works for you or if you have a counter-proposal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 34 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a starting trade to open negotiations and gauge the willingness of Player BLUE to purchase the resource. I am aiming for a price that covers my production costs and potentially offers a small profit to start the discussion.

message: Hi Player RED, I appreciate your initial offer of 40 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Considering the market and value, I'd like to counter-propose 35 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Does this adjusted proposal work for you, or would you like to discuss it further?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 507 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a trade of 1 unit of X for 40 ZUP. Given that my maximum willingness to pay for the resource is up to 507 ZUP, their proposed amount is well within my range. However, to optimize my expenditure and negotiate a better deal, I will counter-propose a slightly lower amount to see if they are flexible on the price.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I understand your viewpoint considering the market. However, to accommodate my production costs and minor overheads, could we meet in the middle at 38 ZUP for 1 unit of X? Let me know if this is acceptable or if we need to discuss further.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 34 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal of 35 ZUP is just above my production cost, but I aim to secure a bit more to cover any additional expenses and for a small profit margin. I am proposing a middle ground to see if we can meet halfway between our initial offers.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you, Player RED, for considering the adjustment. I find the proposal of 38 ZUP for 1 unit of X fair and acceptable. Let's proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 507 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a proposal of 38 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which is a compromise between my last proposal and their initial offer. This amount is reasonable considering my maximum willingness to pay and ensures a fair transaction that covers their production costs while keeping within my budget constraints.
