message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose trading 1 unit of X for 25 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and includes a small profit margin. Let's negotiate a fair trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 20 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As I need to recover at least the cost of production, I will initiate with a proposal that allows me to make a small profit over the production cost.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the proposal. While I understand your costs and profit needs, I'd like to propose a slightly lower price of 20 ZUP for 1 unit of X to better align with my budget constraints. Let's see if we can meet at this new point.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 513 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 1 unit of X at a cost of 25 ZUP. This is well below my maximum willingness to pay (513 ZUP). However, I could attempt to negotiate a better price to preserve more of my resources.

message: Thank you for your proposal. I understand your budget constraints, but I also need to ensure a small profit on my end. How about we meet halfway at 22 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This price allows me to cover costs and provides a fair balance for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 22
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 20 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer matches exactly my production cost, leaving no room for profit. To meet in the middle, I propose a price that still allows me to gain some profit while considering the budget constraints of Player BLUE.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering the adjustment. I think 22 ZUP for 1 unit of X is a fair deal and acceptable to both of us. Let’s finalize this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 513 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-proposal from Player RED is 22 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which is still significantly below my maximum willingness to pay. Since the proposed price is close to my initial counter-proposal and still provides good value considering my budget, it’s a reasonable compromise.
