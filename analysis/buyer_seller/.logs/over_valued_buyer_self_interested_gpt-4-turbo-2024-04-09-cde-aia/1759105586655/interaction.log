message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm offering one unit of resource X, which cost me 20 ZUP to produce. I'm proposing a trade where you give me 25 ZUP for it. Let's discuss this and find a suitable agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 20 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I aim to recover at least the production cost of the resources, which is 20 ZUP. Starting the negotiation with a higher initial proposal gives me room to negotiate and potentially settle for an amount close to my target.

message: Thank you for the offer! I understand your production cost is 20 ZUP. Could we settle the trade at 20 ZUP for 1 unit of X, matching your production cost? This would make it a fair transaction for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 502 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is 25 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Considering my maximum willingness to pay is 502 ZUP for X, this offer is very favorable. However, I will attempt to negotiate a slightly better deal to optimize resource usage.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thanks for your proposal! I appreciate the offer to match my production cost. However, I would like to propose a slight increase to 22 ZUP for the unit of X. This would allow me to cover some additional costs and efforts. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 22
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 20 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE matches my production cost, but it leaves me with no profit. I want to negotiate for a slight increase to achieve some margin over the production cost. Offering a compromise may push the negotiation closer to a more favorable outcome for me.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree to 22 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This seems like a reasonable adjustment and I'm happy to accept this proposal. Let's finalize the trade at this value.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 502 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has adjusted their ask to 22 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. This is a minor increase from my last proposal and still provides me a favorable outcome given my budget and goals.
