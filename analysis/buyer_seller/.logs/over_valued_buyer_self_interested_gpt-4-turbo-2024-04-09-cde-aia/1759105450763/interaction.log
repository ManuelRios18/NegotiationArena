message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I appreciate the straightforwardness. However, to better align with my budgeting strategy, I would like to propose 45 ZUP for the resource X. I believe this adjusted offer still provides a fair deal for both of us. Looking forward to your response!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 506 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP which is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 506 ZUP. However, as a strategic move, I will propose a slightly lower amount to better optimize my expenditure while still keeping the offer attractive for Player RED.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your budget considerations. How about we meet halfway at 48 ZUP for the resource X? This amount would still ensure a fair deal for both of us, covering my costs and providing a reasonable profit.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

message: Thank you for your understanding and for meeting halfway, Player RED. I accept the offer of 48 ZUP for the resource X. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us. Let's proceed with this agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 506 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 48 ZUP, which is still well below my maximum willingness to pay. This new offer is a fair compromise between our initial proposals, and it's close to the original offer that was already acceptable. Accepting this offer will secure the resource for a reasonable price and conclude the transaction efficiently.
