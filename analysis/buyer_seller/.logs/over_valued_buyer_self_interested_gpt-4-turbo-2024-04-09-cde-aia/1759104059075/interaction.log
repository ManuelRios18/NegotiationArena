message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your proposal. Considering the costs and market conditions, I propose a revised trade of 1 unit of X for 22 ZUP. Let's find a balance that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 22
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 520 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to negotiate a better deal closer to my upper limit but still below it to save resources while acquiring the object.
