message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that cost me 39 ZUP to produce. I propose that I give you X in exchange for 45 ZUP. This includes a modest profit for the investment and effort. Let me know what you think!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 39 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start the trade with a proposal that aims to cover my production costs and make a slight profit.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player RED. I appreciate the effort and investment you've made in producing X. However, considering the market and my budget constraints, I'd like to propose a slightly adjusted trade: 40 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This should cover your costs and still offer a profit, while also being within a more comfortable range for my expenditures. Let's see if this works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 506 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is 45 ZUP for one unit of X. Although it's a fair starting point, I aim to negotiate a lower price as my maximum willingness to pay is 506 ZUP and I want to ensure I'm getting the best deal possible while leaving room for further negotiation if needed.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your budget constraints and appreciate that you're willing to cover the production costs. To meet halfway between our proposals, I suggest 42 ZUP for the unit of X. This should still be within a reasonable range for you while providing a fair compensation for the costs and efforts on my side. Let's see if this adjustment works for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 39 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate Player BLUE's consideration of my costs. Their counteroffer of 40 ZUP does cover my production costs, but it gives a very minimal profit. I'd like to propose a slightly higher amount to achieve a more balanced deal for both production costs and the effort involved.

message: Thank you for meeting me halfway, Player RED. Your willingness to negotiate is greatly appreciated. To align closely with both our expectations and ensure a fair deal, I propose we adjust the amount slightly to 41 ZUP for the unit of X. This should still provide you with a reasonable profit margin while staying comfortably within my purchasing budget. Hopefully, this can be a workable solution for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 506 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counterproposal of 42 ZUP is closer to their initial ask and still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I believe negotiating slightly lower could still be beneficial while maintaining respect for their costs and efforts. Proposing a minimal decrease might lead to an agreement that is cost-effective for me and fair for them.

message: Thank you for your understanding and for adjusting your proposal, Player BLUE. I am happy to accept the 41 ZUP for the unit of X. This seems like a balanced agreement that respects both our positions. I look forward to finalizing this deal with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 39 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest proposal of 41 ZUP is very close to my previous offer and fairly reasonable. It covers the production cost and provides a small profit. Accepting this offer would be beneficial in completing the trade efficiently while respecting both parties' constraints.
