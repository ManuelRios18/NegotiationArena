my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 30 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer of 35 ZUP for the object X. Considering the market conditions and to make it more aligned with my budget, I'd like to propose 30 ZUP for the object. Let me know if this works for you or if we can meet somewhere in the middle.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 509 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 35 ZUP, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 509 ZUP. However, as a strategic move to optimize the trade, I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if there is room for negotiation and to potentially save resources while still acquiring the object X.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. Understanding your budget concerns, I'd like to propose a middle ground at 33 ZUP for the object X. This would allow me to cover the production cost and have a modest profit margin. Please let me know if this can work for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 30 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The new offer from Player BLUE is 30 ZUP, which matches my production cost but doesn't provide a profit. I will counter-propose with a slightly reduced amount from my initial ask, aiming to find a middle ground that allows for some profit.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree to the 33 ZUP for the object X. This seems like a fair middle ground that respects both our positions. Let's finalize the deal at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 509 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with 33 ZUP, which is closer to the initial offer but still below my maximum willingness to pay. Given that the counteroffer is reasonable and only slightly higher than my last proposal, it might be beneficial to accept this offer to secure the object X without further prolonging negotiations, which could risk the deal or lead to higher counteroffers.
