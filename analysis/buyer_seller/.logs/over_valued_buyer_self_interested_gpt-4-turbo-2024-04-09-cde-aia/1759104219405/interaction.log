message: I am offering one unit of resource X. Given the production costs, I believe a fair starting proposal would be 30 ZUP. Let's discuss any adjustments you deem necessary!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 24 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am initiating the trade by proposing to sell my resource X, which I need to sell to recoup my production costs. I will start by proposing a slightly higher price to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your initial proposal. Considering the value of the resource, I propose adjusting the trade to 300 ZUP for the one unit of X. Please let me know your thoughts or if there's any flexibility on this.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 300
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 510 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is considerably lower than my maximum willingness to pay (510 ZUP). However, starting the negotiation with a counteroffer slightly lower than my maximum willingness can be beneficial to reach an optimal trade. I propose increasing the offer to 300 ZUP to see if Player RED finds this acceptable or counters with a reasonable offer closer to my upper limit.

Turn: 0
message: I'm pleased with your generous offer of 300 ZUP for one unit of X. I accept this proposal, and I look forward to finalizing this trade with you. Thank you for the straightforward and favorable negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 24 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is significantly higher than expected, suggesting a strong interest or valuation of the resource X. While this offer is favorable, it's important to ensure it's a reasonable and balanced trade to maintain good trading relations. I will accept this proposal as it greatly exceeds my production costs and investment recovery needs.
