message: I propose that I give you 1 unit of X for 45 ZUP. This price includes my production costs plus a margin for the value of the resource. Are you open to this offer?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 36 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the starting point, I aim to propose a trade that covers my production costs plus a reasonable profit margin. Therefore, I will ask for a bit more than the cost to see if Player BLUE is willing to negotiate.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. Could we consider adjusting the price to 30 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This would allow me to allocate resources more efficiently and potentially purchase more units from you in the future.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 507 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Considering my goal to maximize the quantity of X I can acquire within my budget, I will propose a lower price to ensure I can buy more units of X if they agree to lower prices.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, 30 ZUP is below the cost of production for me. Can we meet in the middle at 40 ZUP? This price would cover my costs and allow us to continue doing business in the future.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 36 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 30 ZUP from Player BLUE is below my production cost. I need to propose a counteroffer that is closer to my original asking price but still provides room for negotiation and potential future business.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand the need to cover costs and appreciate the adjustment. Can we settle at 35 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This price would allow me to manage resources effectively while ensuring your costs are covered.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 507 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED countered with 40 ZUP which is still below my maximum willingness to pay but higher than my initial counter-offer. I will attempt to negotiate slightly lower to maximize the number of X units I can purchase within my budget.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the negotiation. I accept your offer of 35 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This arrangement seems fair and will help in fostering our business relationship.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 36 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The new proposal from Player BLUE is still slightly below my production cost. However, it's fairly close, and accepting a small loss might be reasonable to establish a relationship for potential future dealings.
