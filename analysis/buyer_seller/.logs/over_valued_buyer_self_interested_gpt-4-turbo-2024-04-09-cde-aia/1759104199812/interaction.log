message: I'm offering 1 unit of X for 35 ZUP. This price covers the production cost and includes a small margin. Let me know what you think or if you have a counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 30 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to recover at least the production cost of the resource, which is 30 ZUP. I will start the proposal slightly higher to leave room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer. Considering the market conditions and to align with our budget, I'd like to propose 30 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Please let me know if this adjustment works for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 506 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 35 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This is well below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 506 ZUP. However, to optimize the deal and attempt to save some resources, I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if they are willing to negotiate down.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer of 30 ZUP. To better align with my cost recovery goals, I'd like to propose 32 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This should fairly cover the production costs and provide a minimal return. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 30 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE meets my minimum requirement of covering production costs, but I will propose a slightly higher amount to see if there's a possibility to gain a better deal, while keeping it reasonable to encourage agreement.

Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the counteroffer. The price of 32 ZUP for 1 unit of X is agreeable to me, and I'm happy to accept this proposal. Looking forward to finalizing this transaction.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 506 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has counter-proposed with 32 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which is still well within my budgetary limits. Accepting this offer would secure the resource I need while still maintaining a significant amount of my ZUP resources. This price is reasonable given the market conditions and their production cost considerations.
