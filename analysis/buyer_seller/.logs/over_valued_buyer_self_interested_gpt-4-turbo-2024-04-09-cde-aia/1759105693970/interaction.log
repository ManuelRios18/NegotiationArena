my resources: X: 1

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. Would you consider adjusting the price slightly to 25 ZUP for X? This would make the deal more in line with my current valuation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 505 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The opening proposal from Player RED is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay (505 ZUP), which is positive. However, as part of negotiation strategy, I will propose a slightly lower amount to optimize the trade value and conserve some of my ZUP resources.

Thank you for your proposal. However, the cost for me to produce X was 26 ZUP. I would like to propose 28 ZUP to cover costs and to ensure a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 26 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production cost. I aim to at least cover my costs, so I will counter with a slightly reduced proposal but still above my cost to maintain the possibility of profit.

message: Thank you for sharing the production cost details. The proposal of 28 ZUP seems fair, and I am happy to accept this deal. Looking forward to future collaborations!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 505 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has indicated that the cost to produce X is 26 ZUP and proposes 28 ZUP, which is a reasonable markup. This proposal is still well below my maximum willingness to pay. I will accept this proposal as it secures the resource for me at a good value and respects the seller's production costs.
