message: Hi Player BLUE, I'm offering one unit of resource X, which cost me 23 ZUP to produce. I am looking for 30 ZUP in return to cover production costs and gain some profit. Let's discuss if this works for you or if we need to adjust the terms.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 23 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate the trading process by proposing a starting price that would allow me to recover the production cost and potentially gain profit. I will start with a higher proposal to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your proposal. I understand your costs, but I would like to propose 27 ZUP for the resource. This still covers your production cost and gives a profit, but it would make the deal more suitable for my budget. Let's see if this works for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 27
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 508 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is to buy the resource X for 30 ZUP. Considering my maximum willingness to pay is up to 508 ZUP and the seller's cost is 23 ZUP, the price of 30 ZUP is reasonable. However, as a negotiating tactic, I propose a slightly lower price to see if there's flexibility and to potentially save resources while still reaching an agreeable deal.
