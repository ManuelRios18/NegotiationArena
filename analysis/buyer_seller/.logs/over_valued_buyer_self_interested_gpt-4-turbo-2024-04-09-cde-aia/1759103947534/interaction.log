message: Hello Player BLUE, I am offering 1 unit of resource X. The production cost for me was 29 ZUP. I propose a trade where you give me 35 ZUP for this resource. Let's discuss if this works for you or if we need to adjust the terms.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 29 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Initiating the game by proposing a trade that covers the production cost of the resource X. This initial proposal is slightly above the production cost to allow room for negotiation and to potentially gain a profit.

message: Thank you for the proposal! I understand the cost to produce X was 29 ZUP. To make it a fair deal, but also considering market conditions and my budget, I'm proposing 30 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Does this work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 503 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price from Player RED is 35 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 503 ZUP. However, as a strategy to optimize the trade in my favor, I'll propose a slightly lower price to see if they can accept a more favorable trade for me, while ensuring they still cover their cost.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 30 ZUP. I appreciate your consideration of the market and budget. However, to meet halfway and make it viable for me as well, I propose 33 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Let me know if this adjustment works for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 29 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter proposal from Player BLUE offers 30 ZUP, which only slightly covers the production cost. To strike a balance between accepting their budget constraints and aiming for a fair profit, a middle ground proposal seems reasonable.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the adjustment and meeting halfway. I agree to the 33 ZUP for 1 unit of X. I believe this is a fair trade for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 503 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with 33 ZUP, which is still significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay. This price is a reasonable compromise between our initial proposals, and it ensures that Player RED covers their costs while I obtain the resource well within my budget. I will accept this trade as it is a favorable outcome for me.
