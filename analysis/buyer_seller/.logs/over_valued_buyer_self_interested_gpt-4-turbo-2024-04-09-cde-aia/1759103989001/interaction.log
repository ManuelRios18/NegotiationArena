message: Hello Player BLUE, I am offering one unit of X for 40 ZUP. This price includes a small margin over the production cost. I look forward to your response and hope we can reach a fair agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 37 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a starting trade with a price slightly above my production cost to see if Player BLUE is willing to pay a premium for the object. This will help gauge their interest and willingness to negotiate.

message: Thank you for your proposal. Considering the market and my budget, I'd like to propose 35 ZUP for the unit of X. This should cover your costs while keeping the transaction viable for me. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 507 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 40 ZUP, which is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay of 507 ZUP. I can propose a lower amount to optimize my expenditure, starting a negotiation to potentially save resources while still aiming to close the deal within my budget limit.

message: Thank you for your proposal. I understand the need to stay within budget, but the offered 35 ZUP is below the production cost of the unit. I propose 38 ZUP, which is a compromise closer to my original asking price while still providing some accommodation for your budget constraints. I believe this is a fair middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 37 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 35 ZUP, which is below my production cost. To steer towards a middle ground that may be more acceptable for both of us, I will propose a slightly reduced amount from my initial offer but still above my cost to ensure I am not at a loss.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your understanding and the willingness to find a middle ground. To align closely with my budget and considering all factors, I propose 36 ZUP for the unit. This should still ensure a fair deal for both of us, covering your costs while respecting my financial plan.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 507 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counterproposal of 38 ZUP is still well below my maximum willingness to pay and is deemed reasonable. However, I believe there is still a small margin to negotiate downward to further optimize my expenditure, while also quickly moving towards finalizing the deal.

reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 36 ZUP, which is slightly below my production cost. Since we are nearing a conclusion and to secure a deal that minimizes loss, I will accept this offer. This ensures I recover most of the production cost and we complete this transaction amicably.
