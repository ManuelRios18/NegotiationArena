message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This price reflects the value and the production cost of the resource. Let me know your thoughts!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 35 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my object X for a profit over its production cost of 35 ZUP, hence I start with a proposal that offers a reasonable profit margin while still being attractive to the buyer.

message: Thank you for the initial offer. I believe the resource X has substantial value, so I'd like to propose a counter-offer of 200 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This price might better reflect the utility and market demand. Let's discuss further if you have thoughts or a counter proposal!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 200
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 517 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is quite low compared to my maximum willingness to pay (517 ZUP for X). However, starting with a counter offer slightly higher but still well below my upper limit could set the stage for a favorable negotiation. This will also test Player RED's flexibility on the price.

my resources: X: 1
