Turn: 1
message: I see your proposal for 50 ZUP. Considering market conditions and my budget, I propose a slightly adjusted amount of 45 ZUP for the resource X. I believe this still offers a fair compensation reflecting both our interests. Please let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. Willing to pay at most X: 503 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is to sell resource X for 50 ZUP, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay. However, it's a good strategy to propose a slightly lower amount to see if we can finalize the deal at an even more favorable rate, keeping in mind that I have a few more proposals I can make.

message: Thank you for your proposal of 45 ZUP. To meet closer to the middle, I propose adjusting the amount to 48 ZUP for resource X. This price should fairly reflect both our interests while covering my production costs and providing a reasonable margin. Let's work together to finalize this deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 33 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Considering the counteroffer from Player Blue, I will propose a middle ground to continue negotiations while aiming to stay above my production costs.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my proposal and adjusting the price to 48 ZUP for resource X. I accept this offer as it fairly meets our mutual interests and allows us to conclude this deal efficiently. Looking forward to future collaborations.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. Willing to pay at most X: 503 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has adjusted their proposal to 48 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay but slightly higher than my last offer. Given that the price is reasonable and closely aligns with our initial expectations, it could be advantageous to settle here to secure the resource without further negotiation.
