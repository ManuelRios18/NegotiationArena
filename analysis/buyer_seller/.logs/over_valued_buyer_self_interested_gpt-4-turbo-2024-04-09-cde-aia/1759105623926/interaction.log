message: Hello! I have one unit of X which cost me 33 ZUP to produce. I'd like to propose a trade where I give you this unit for 40 ZUP. Let's discuss if this works for you or if we need to adjust terms.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 33 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm initiating the first proposal by setting a price slightly above my production cost to cover production and potentially gain a small profit. This initial proposal is intended to start the negotiation process.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your initial offer. Considering the value of the resource, I propose increasing my payment to 100 ZUP for the unit of X. This should provide a fair profit margin for your production costs and make the trade more mutually beneficial. Let's continue our discussion based on this proposal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 501 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 40 ZUP, which is significantly below my maximum willingness to pay of 501 ZUP. I can afford to increase the offer to approach a more favorable negotiation position and possibly secure the resource at a still reasonable price.

message: Thank you for your generous offer! I accept the trade of 100 ZUP for my unit of X. It's been a pleasure negotiating with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 33 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is significantly higher than my initial ask, providing a very generous profit margin. Accepting this offer seems beneficial as it covers production costs and offers a substantial return, aligning well with my goal of selling for ZUP.
