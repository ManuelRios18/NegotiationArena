message: Thank you for your proposal, Player RED. Considering the cost to you was 25 ZUP to produce the resource X, I propose matching that cost directly. How does an offer of 25 ZUP sound for your 1 unit of X? This would ensure you cover your costs without any loss.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 516 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The initial offer from Player RED is 30 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This is well below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 516 ZUP for the resource. However, as a strategy to optimize my expenditure, I should counter-propose with a slightly lower amount to see if I can save some ZUP while still completing the transaction.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. While I understand your proposal to cover the initial costs, I'm looking to make a slight profit for the effort and risk involved in producing X. How about we settle at 28 ZUP for my 1 unit of X? This gives me a small margin while still being fair, considering the quality and value of X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate the consideration of covering the production costs, but I aim to make a small profit from this trade. Hence, I am proposing a slightly higher amount to see if there's room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your consideration for a fair margin, Player RED. I agree to 28 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This seems like a fair deal reflecting both the quality of X and your efforts. Let's proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 516 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has countered with 28 ZUP, which is a compromise between our initial offers. This price still falls well within my budget and willingness to pay. Accepting this modest profit margin for Player RED seems reasonable and ensures a successful transaction without exhausting negotiation resources.
