message: Hello BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you 1 X in exchange for 35 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and provides a small profit margin. Let's discuss if this works for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 32 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing an initial trade to start the negotiation process, aiming to cover at least the cost I incurred in producing the resource.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your proposal. I understand your costs and profit needs. Could we consider adjusting the price slightly? How about 45 ZUP for 1 X? This could potentially cover more of your costs and still be within a reasonable range for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 512 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from RED is 35 ZUP for 1 X, which is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay. I will propose a slightly higher amount to see if RED is open to negotiating for a higher price, ensuring a better deal for myself while staying well below my upper limit.
