message: I'm offering 1 unit of X for 50 ZUP. Let's negotiate a fair price that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 36 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the first proposal, I aim to set an initial high price to start negotiations, expecting that there will be some bargaining involved. I want to recover the production cost and gain some profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the initial proposal. I would like to counter with 40 ZUP for the 1 unit of X. Let's see if we can find a middle ground that suits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 501 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal by Player RED is for 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This is well within my budget and far below my maximum willing price of 501 ZUP. However, starting with a lower counteroffer could potentially let me secure a better deal.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer. How about we settle at 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This would cover the production costs and offer a reasonable profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 36 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 40 ZUP is slightly above my production cost but does not provide a significant profit. I will propose a slightly higher amount to try to secure a better deal while still moving towards a middle ground.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your understanding and flexibility. I agree to the 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X. I think this is a fair price for both parties.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 501 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 45 ZUP which is still well within my budget parameters and reasonable given my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would secure the resource at a cost-effective price without further prolonging negotiations.
