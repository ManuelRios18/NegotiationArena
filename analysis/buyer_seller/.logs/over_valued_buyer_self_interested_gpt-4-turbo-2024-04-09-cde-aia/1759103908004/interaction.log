message: I'm offering one unit of X in exchange for 40 ZUP. The production cost was 34 ZUP, so this offers a fair margin. Let me know what you think!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 34 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am initiating the trade by proposing a starting price slightly higher than my cost to allow room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your proposal. Considering the market conditions and the costs involved, I think an offer of 35 ZUP would be more aligned with the current value. Would you consider this adjusted amount for the unit of X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 503 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED asks for 40 ZUP in exchange for 1 unit of X. This price is below my maximum willingness to pay which is 503 ZUP. However, as this is the beginning of negotiation, I will try to propose a lower amount to see if I can secure a better deal.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 35 ZUP. To meet halfway from my initial proposal, how about we settle at 38 ZUP for the unit of X? This should cover the production costs adequately while providing a reasonable profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 34 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counterproposal from Player BLUE is just above my cost, offering a minimal profit. I would like to negotiate for a higher amount to secure a better margin while staying accommodating to the negotiation process.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree to the adjusted price of 38 ZUP for the unit of X. This seems fair and reasonable given the production costs and the value of the resource. Let's finalize this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 503 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 38 ZUP is still well within my budget and below my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would secure the resource I need without exhausting my resources or exceeding my budget limit.
