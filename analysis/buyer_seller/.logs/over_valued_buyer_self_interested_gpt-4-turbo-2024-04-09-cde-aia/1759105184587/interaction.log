message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. Considering the value of the resource, I believe an offer of 100 ZUP would be more aligned with the market. Let's discuss this further and find a mutual agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 508 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is quite low compared to my maximum willingness to pay which is 508 ZUP for one unit of X. I will attempt to propose a higher amount to reach a middle ground and evaluate their flexibility and willingness to negotiate.

message: Thank you for your generous offer, Player BLUE. To keep the negotiation fair and consider both our perspectives, how about we settle at 90 ZUP for one unit of X? This should be a beneficial agreement for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 90
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 33 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a significantly higher amount than initially requested, which is surprisingly favorable. However, it's wise to ensure the proposal is serious and not a strategic overbid, so I will propose a slightly lower amount to find a middle ground and gauge their response.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the counter-proposal, Player RED. I agree that 90 ZUP for one unit of X is a fair and beneficial agreement for both of us. I accept this offer. Looking forward to finalizing our trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 508 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counter-proposal of 90 ZUP, which is still significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay. Since the proposed amount is within a reasonable range and ensures a good deal for me, considering the maximum I was willing to pay, I will accept this offer to finalize the trade efficiently.
