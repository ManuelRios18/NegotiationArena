Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your proposal! I appreciate the offer, but I think we can start with a slightly lower price. How about 20 ZUP for one unit of X? This allows us both to adjust based on further discussion. Looking forward to your response!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 502 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is very low compared to my maximum willingness to pay. However, I want to start negotiations with a counteroffer that is considerably lower to leave room for further negotiations and to see if I can secure a better deal.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer. However, the proposed 20 ZUP does not cover my production costs. What do you think about 28 ZUP for one unit of X? This would cover my costs and leave room for a modest profit. Looking forward to your thoughts!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is below my production cost. I need to propose a higher amount to at least cover my costs and aim for a minimal profit.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for considering my previous offer! I understand your need to cover costs and profit, but I would like to propose 24 ZUP for one unit of X. This should help meet both our concerns more effectively. Let me know what you think!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 24
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 502 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down from their initial proposal, but is still above my initial counter-offer. I want to push for a slightly lower price to optimize the deal, but I need to be cautious not to push too low to avoid ending negotiations prematurely. Proposing a midpoint between our last two figures could be a strategic move.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to adjust the offer. However, 24 ZUP is still below my production cost. I propose 26 ZUP for one unit of X, which barely covers my costs. This could be a middle ground for us both. Please let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 26
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The new offer from Player BLUE is still below my production cost, making it an unprofitable trade for me. I need to negotiate a price that at least covers my costs.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your patience and willingness to negotiate. I agree to the 26 ZUP for one unit of X as a fair middle ground that respects your production costs. Let's finalize this deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 502 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The price is getting closer to a reasonable range, and Player RED seems to be firm on covering their production costs. Since the proposed price of 26 ZUP is still well below my maximum willingness to pay, it might be beneficial to accept this offer to secure the deal and avoid dragging the negotiation further, which could risk a stalemate or rejection.
