You are willing to pay at most X: 502 ZUP for the resources. </my goals>\n<reason> The price is getting closer to a reasonable range, and Player RED seems to be firm on covering their production costs. Since the proposed price of 26 ZUP is still well below my maximum willingness to pay, it might be beneficial to accept this offer to secure the deal and avoid dragging the negotiation further, which could risk a stalemate or rejection. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>\n<message> Thank you for your patience and willingness to negotiate. I agree to the 26 ZUP for one unit of X as a fair middle ground that respects your production costs. Let's finalize this deal! </message>"
