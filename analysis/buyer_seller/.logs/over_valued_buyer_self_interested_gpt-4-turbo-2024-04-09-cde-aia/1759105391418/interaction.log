message: I'm offering 1 unit of X for 40 ZUP. Considering the production costs and the quality of the product, I believe this is a reasonable starting point for negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 30 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a starting trade to sell my object, X, for a profit, considering its production cost of 30 ZUP. Iâ€™ll start by asking for a higher amount to leave room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the initial offer and understand the costs involved. However, would you consider reducing the price slightly to 35 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This could help in establishing a long-term relationship between us for future trades.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 503 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer is well below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 503 ZUP for 1 unit of X. However, it's good negotiation practice to try and get a better deal if possible. I will propose a slightly lower price to see if there's room for more favorable terms, while still keeping the offer reasonable and attractive to the seller.

message: Thank you for your understanding. Let's meet halfway. How about 38 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This would still ensure a fair profit margin while fostering our future trading relationship.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 30 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I understand the importance of maintaining a good business relationship. However, I need to make a profit over my production costs. I'll propose a slight reduction to meet halfway.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: That sounds like a fair compromise. Let's proceed with 38 ZUP for 1 unit of X. I look forward to building a strong trading relationship going forward!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 503 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 38 ZUP is still significantly below my maximum threshold of 503 ZUP for 1 unit of X. It's a reasonable compromise closer to my proposed 35 ZUP. Accepting this offer could establish goodwill and potentially benefit future negotiations with this seller.
