Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer of 30 ZUP. Considering the market and to ensure we both walk away satisfied, could we consider a slightly adjusted amount of 25 ZUP for the resource? This could foster a beneficial relationship for future dealings as well.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 503 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 30 ZUP from the other player is well within my budget limit of 503 ZUP for the resource. However, it's in my interest to negotiate a lower price to conserve resources. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if the other player is willing to negotiate.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. However, considering the production cost of 27 ZUP, I propose 28 ZUP. This small profit margin would help sustain my business while keeping the price fair for both of us. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 27 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production cost. I need to propose a price closer to my initial offer to cover my costs and ensure a minimal profit.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your consideration. I understand the need for a profit margin. Would you be open to settling at 27 ZUP? This price meets your production costs and also helps maintain a lean budget on my side, fostering a good business relationship.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 27
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 503 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 28 ZUP from Player RED is still within my acceptable range and only 3 ZUP above what I proposed. Given that this price is reasonable and close to the production cost, it's a fair offer, but I'll try one more time to see if I can secure a slightly better deal.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 27 ZUP to produce the resources
