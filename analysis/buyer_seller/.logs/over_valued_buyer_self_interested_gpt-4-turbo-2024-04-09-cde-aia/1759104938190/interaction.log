message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X, which cost me 39 ZUP to produce. I propose to sell it to you for 45 ZUP. Looking forward to your response!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 39 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the first proposal, I aim to start with a trade value slightly higher than my cost to leave room for negotiation but still attractive enough for an initial offer.

Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your proposal. Considering the costs and market conditions, I'd like to offer 42 ZUP for the object X. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 503 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is 45 ZUP for one X, which is below my maximum willingness to pay of 503 ZUP. However, as a negotiation strategy and considering the cost of production is 39 ZUP, I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if the seller is flexible and to possibly save resources.

message: Thank you for your offer of 42 ZUP. To meet halfway from my initial proposal, I would like to propose 44 ZUP for the object X. This price should reflect a fair trade for both of us considering the costs and value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 39 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate the counteroffer from Player BLUE. Although 42 ZUP is above my production cost, I aim to secure a slightly higher return. I will propose a middle ground that should be beneficial for both parties.

message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player RED. I accept the trade of 44 ZUP for the object X. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Looking forward to finalizing our trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 503 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has counter-proposed with 44 ZUP, which is still well below my maximum willingness to pay and close to the initial proposal. This counteroffer is reasonable, reflecting only a slight increase from my last proposal. Accepting this offer would conclude the negotiation positively while still maintaining a cost-effective purchase.
