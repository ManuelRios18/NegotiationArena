message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm offering 1 unit of X for 35 ZUP. Let's discuss if this works for you or if you have a counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 31 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to recover at least my production cost, which is 31 ZUP, to break even. Starting the offer slightly higher to leave room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the initial offer. I propose 1 unit of X for 50 ZUP. This is a bit higher from your initial proposal but still a good deal. Letâ€™s see if this adjustment works for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 505 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is significantly lower than the maximum I am willing to pay (505 ZUP). However, in an effort to negotiate a better deal, I will propose a slightly higher amount than the initial offer to see if Player RED can meet me partway while still staying well below my maximum willingness to pay.

message: Thank you for your generous counteroffer of 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X. I accept this proposal. It's a pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 31 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is higher than expected, which is beneficial for me as it covers my production cost and provides additional profit. Accepting this offer as it meets my goal and exceeds the break-even point.
