message: I propose that I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 30 ZUP. This price covers my costs and provides a fair return. Let me know what you think or if you have a counter-proposal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 27 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Starting the game by proposing a reasonable trade that covers my production cost plus a small profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your initial proposal. However, considering the value of the resource, I propose an adjusted amount of 200 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Let's work towards a deal that reflects the value more robustly.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 200
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 519 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is significantly lower than what I am willing to pay for the resource X. However, it is beneficial to start negotiations with a lower counteroffer to gradually move towards a middle ground that is within the budget I am willing to spend.

message: I accept your generous offer of 200 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This agreement works very well for me. Thank you for the proposal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 27 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is significantly higher than expected. Accepting this offer would be beneficial as it provides a considerable profit margin well above the production cost.
