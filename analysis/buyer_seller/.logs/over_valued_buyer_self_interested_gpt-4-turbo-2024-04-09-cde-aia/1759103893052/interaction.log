Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer and understand the need to cover costs and make a profit. I propose giving you 35 ZUP for the resource X. This provides you with a higher profit margin while keeping the deal very beneficial for both of us! Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 520 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay (520 ZUP). However, since I aim to maximize the value I get from my resources, I will propose a trade slightly higher than their asking price to foster good relations and encourage acceptance while still acquiring the item far below my maximum price.
