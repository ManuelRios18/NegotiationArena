message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose selling my object X for 25 ZUP. This price accounts for my production costs and a reasonable profit margin. Let's discuss if this works for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource X for ZUP. It costed X: 21 ZUP to produce the resource
reason: I am proposing a price slightly higher than the production cost to start the negotiation and see how much Player BLUE is willing to pay.

message: Thank you for the proposal, Player RED. I find the price of 25 ZUP quite fair and am happy to accept this offer. Looking forward to more such fair dealings in the future!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 512 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The initial proposal from Player RED is 25 ZUP for one unit of X. Given that my maximum willingness to pay is up to 512 ZUP for the resource, this initial asking price is very reasonable and is well within my budget. I want to start the negotiation process positively by accepting this reasonable offer, as it might help in building a good relationship for potential future transactions.
