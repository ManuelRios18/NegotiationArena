You are willing to pay at most X: 519 ZUP for the resources. </my goals>\n<reason> The latest proposal from Player RED is just slightly above my last offer, showing their flexibility and nearing their break-even point. Since the proposed amount, 34 ZUP, is still substantially below my maximum threshold, accepting this deal ensures I get the resource at a reasonable cost without exhausting the negotiation limit. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>\n<message> I appreciate your effort to find a fair price that covers your costs. I accept your offer of 34 ZUP for one unit of X. This seems like a balanced and fair deal for both of us. Looking forward to finalizing this agreement. </message>"
