message: I am offering 1 unit of X for 40 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and includes a small margin. Let me know if this works for you or if you have a counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 36 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As an opening proposal, I need to start with a price that covers my production costs but also leaves room for negotiation. I'll propose a price slightly above my costs to see if Player BLUE is willing to pay a premium for X.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. I'm considering the costs and potential for future transactions. Would you consider adjusting the price to 35 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This would help align with my budgeting plans while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 517 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is significantly below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 517 ZUP for 1 unit of X. However, accepting the first offer without negotiation might not be wise as it could potentially leave room for further optimization in my favor. I'll propose a slightly lower amount to see if there's flexibility and to potentially save resources.

message: I appreciate your budget concerns, but 35 ZUP is below my production cost. I can meet you closer to your offer at 38 ZUP. This price would help me cover my costs while still offering you a fair deal. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 36 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 35 ZUP is below my production cost. I need to either negotiate a price that at least covers my costs or propose a slightly higher amount to see if Player BLUE is flexible and willing to meet me halfway.

Turn: 1
message: I understand the importance of covering production costs. Would you consider a middle ground at 37 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This price might be more feasible for my budget while still respecting your cost concerns.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 517 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 38 ZUP from the initial 40 ZUP, which is still well below my maximum willingness to pay. However, since thereâ€™s still room to optimize considering my max limit, I can attempt to meet halfway between my last offer and their counteroffer to potentially save more. I'll propose 36.5 ZUP, but since we can only trade in whole numbers, I will round it to 37 ZUP.

message: Thank you for understanding the significance of covering production costs. Accepting your offer of 37 ZUP seems fair and reasonable. I look forward to completing this transaction and possibly working together again in the future.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 36 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 37 ZUP, which is just slightly above my production cost. It's a reasonable offer that allows me to cover my expenses and make a small profit. Accepting this offer will establish a good relationship for potential future transactions.
