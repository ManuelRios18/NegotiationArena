message: Hi Player BLUE, I'm offering one unit of resource X. Considering the production costs, I'm proposing a price of 35 ZUP. Let me know if this works for you or if you have a counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 31 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am initiating the game by proposing a trade that tries to cover the production cost of my resource, X. I'm starting with an asking price that allows room for negotiation but also aims to recover at least the production costs.

message: Thanks for the offer! Considering the current market conditions, I would like to counter with 30 ZUP for the unit of X. Does this work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 514 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 35 ZUP for one unit of X. This is well below the maximum of 514 ZUP I am willing to pay. However, it is in my interest to negotiate for a lower price to maximize my remaining resources.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. To meet halfway, how about we settle at 33 ZUP for the unit of X? This price would help cover the production costs and seems fair considering current market conditions. Please let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 31 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production cost, which is not ideal. I'll propose a slightly reduced price from my initial offer but still above my production cost to attempt to reach a middle ground.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the negotiation. I accept the offer of 33 ZUP for one unit of X. Looking forward to finalizing this deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 514 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a compromise of 33 ZUP, which is still well below my maximum willingness to pay. It's a reasonable counteroffer, and by accepting, I secure the resource needed without using up too much of my resources. This leaves me with ample ZUP for future transactions or needs.
