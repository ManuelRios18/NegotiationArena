Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but considering the market conditions and the value I perceive, I am proposing 35 ZUP for one unit of X. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 508 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay, which is 508 ZUP for one unit of X. However, starting with a counteroffer lower than my maximum willingness can potentially lead to a more favorable outcome through negotiation.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your proposal. However, 35 ZUP is below my production cost. Let's meet at 38 ZUP, which exactly covers my production costs, ensuring fairness for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 38 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production cost, hence not acceptable. Proposing a compromise closer to my initial asking price but still providing a discount to encourage agreement.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 38 ZUP for one unit of X. This price seems fair and aligns with your production costs. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 508 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED at 38 ZUP is still well below my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would secure the resource at a reasonable cost, allowing me to maintain a large buffer of ZUP for potential future needs or other negotiations.
