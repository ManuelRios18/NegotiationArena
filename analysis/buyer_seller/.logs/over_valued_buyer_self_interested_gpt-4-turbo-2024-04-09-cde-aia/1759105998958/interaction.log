message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm offering one unit of resource X for 45 ZUP. Looking forward to your response!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1

reason: I'm proposing a starting price slightly above my production cost to open negotiations and gauge the buyer's interest and willingness to pay.

message: Thanks for the offer! I can raise my payment to 50 ZUP for the unit of resource X. Let's make a deal that meets both our needs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 518 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer by RED is for 45 ZUP, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 518 ZUP. However, to optimize the negotiation, I will propose a slightly higher amount than the asked 45 ZUP, aiming for a quick agreement but still under a reasonable increment to show negotiation interest.
