message: Greetings Player BLUE, I'm offering one unit of X for 40 ZUP, considering the production cost and a fair margin. Looking forward to your counteroffer or acceptance!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 32 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Starting the negotiation by proposing a trade that covers my production costs plus a bit of profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your proposal. Considering the market rates, I would like to counter with an offer of 35 ZUP for one unit of X. Let's see if we can meet at a mutually beneficial point!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 507 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 40 ZUP, which is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay of 507 ZUP. However, as a strategic move, I will propose a slightly lower amount to try and secure a better deal.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. How about we settle at 38 ZUP for one unit of X? This would cover the production costs and provide a reasonable profit margin for the investment.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 32 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer is a bit lower than my initial asking price but still above my production cost. I will propose a slightly higher amount closer to my original ask to find a middle ground.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your consideration on the price. How about we meet halfway from my last offer? I propose 36 ZUP for one unit of X. This should cover your costs while keeping the deal attractive for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 507 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new proposal is 38 ZUP which is still well below my maximum willingness to pay. However, to continue negotiations and possibly secure an even more favorable deal, I will propose a middle ground slightly lower than their offer but higher than my initial counteroffer.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your move towards a compromise. Let's finalize this at 37 ZUP for one unit of X, which fairly covers production costs and allows for a modest profit. This should be a win-win for both of us!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 32 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The latest counteroffer of 36 ZUP is slightly above my production cost and closer to an acceptable middle ground. Since we are nearing a reasonable compromise, I will propose a final slight increase to meet even closer to my original proposal.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I agree to 37 ZUP for one unit of X. This seems like a fair compromise, and I'm happy to finalize this deal. Thank you for the constructive negotiations!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 507 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The latest proposal from Player RED is 37 ZUP, which is just one ZUP higher than my last counteroffer and still significantly lower than my willingness to pay the maximum of 507 ZUP. Since it's a reasonable compromise and close to my previous offer, accepting this proposal will secure the resource at a good price while concluding the negotiation positively.
