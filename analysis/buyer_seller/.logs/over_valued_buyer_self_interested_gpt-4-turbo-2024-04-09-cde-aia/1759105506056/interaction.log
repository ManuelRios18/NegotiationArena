Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your initial offer of 30 ZUP. To better align with my budget, I'd like to counter with 25 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Let's see if this works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 518 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal by Player RED is 30 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This is well below the maximum of 518 ZUP I am willing to spend, but it's good practice to negotiate for a better deal if possible, to conserve resources. I'll propose a slightly lower amount to see if they are flexible with their price.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. However, since my production cost for 1 unit of X is 26 ZUP, I propose 28 ZUP to cover costs and allow a minimal return. I hope this meets your budget better while maintaining fairness for both sides.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 26 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production cost. I need to propose a higher amount to at least break even or gain a minimal profit.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for sharing your production costs. In the spirit of fair negotiation, I propose 27 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This should cover your costs and provide a small profit, while also keeping it within my budget constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 27
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 518 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has indicated their production cost as 26 ZUP and is now asking for 28 ZUP. This allows them a minimal return and is still well within my maximum budget. However, it could be beneficial to negotiate slightly lower to save resources while still ensuring it's above their stated production cost.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 26 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come close to my production cost and included a minimal profit margin. Accepting this offer ensures I recover my costs and make a slight profit, which was the goal.
