Turn: 0
message: I'm offering one unit of X, which cost me 35 ZUP to produce. Let's start the negotiation at 40 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 35 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I aim to make a profit on the item I'm selling, which cost me 35 ZUP to produce. I will start by proposing a price slightly higher than my costs to see if Player BLUE is willing to pay more, understanding that negotiations may bring the price down.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand that your production cost is 35 ZUP per unit of X. I'd like to propose 35 ZUP for one unit of X to align with your production cost and ensure a fair transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 508 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since the starting offer is 40 ZUP for one unit of X, which is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay (508 ZUP), I can make a counteroffer slightly lower than the initial offer to try to get a better deal, considering the cost to produce X is 35 ZUP according to Player RED.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 35 ZUP, which covers my production costs. However, I was hoping to gain a slight profit for my efforts and investment. Could we meet in the middle at 38 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 35 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While Player BLUE has proposed to cover my production costs, I initially aimed to make a profit. However, considering the negotiation process, I might need to adjust my expectations. I'll propose a slightly higher price to find a middle ground that might be acceptable for both of us without straying too far from their offer.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree to 38 ZUP for one unit of X. It's a fair price that respects both your need for profit and my budget constraints. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 508 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-proposal of 38 ZUP is reasonable, as it is still well below my maximum willingness to pay. It allows Player RED to make a profit while keeping the cost effective for me. This proposal aligns with our mutual interests, so I will accept the offer.
