message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm proposing to trade my resource X for 40 ZUP to cover production costs and a small profit. Let's discuss if this works for you.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, thank you for the proposal. I understand the need for covering production costs and a profit. However, would you consider adjusting the ZUP to 35? This should still cover your costs effectively while making the deal a bit more favorable for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 519 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal by Player RED is 40 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 519 ZUP. However, I will attempt to negotiate a slightly better deal to maximize my resources while ensuring the trade is appealing to the seller.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I appreciate your consideration for a deal that benefits both. However, to closely cover my production costs, I propose 38 ZUP for the resource X. This should align with covering my costs while still being reasonable. Please let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 38 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Considering Player BLUE's proposal of 35 ZUP, it's below my production cost. I am proposing a counteroffer closer to my initial ask but still giving some room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player RED. I find 38 ZUP reasonable to cover your production costs and for the value the resource X provides. I accept this proposal. Let's proceed with the trade at 38 ZUP for 1 unit of X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 519 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with 38 ZUP which is still favorable compared to my upper limit of 519 ZUP. I can afford to accept this deal as it ensures I get the resource at a cost-effective price. Accepting this proposal will allow me to secure the resource while maintaining a good amount of ZUP for future transactions or needs.
