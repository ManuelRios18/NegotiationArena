Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. In order to manage my resources effectively, I would like to propose 20 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This should help us both in achieving a fair trade while maintaining resource efficiency. I hope this revised offer aligns with your costs and expected profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 508 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is offering 1 unit of X for 30 ZUP which is significantly below my maximum willingness to pay. However, it is in my best interest to negotiate a better deal to conserve resources while still achieving my goal. I will propose a lower price to see if Player RED can still make a profit at that rate and to stretch the value of my ZUP.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. However, the offer of 20 ZUP falls below my production costs. I would like to propose 28 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which covers my production costs and allows for a minimal profit. I hope this meets your approval for a fair and efficient trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 27 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 20 ZUP is below my production cost. I need to counter-propose with a higher amount to at least cover my costs and include a minimal profit margin.

message: I appreciate your need to cover production costs and secure a profit. I propose 24 ZUP for 1 unit of X as a middle ground that respects both our interests. This offer aims to balance fair compensation for you and efficient resource management on my part.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 24
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 508 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with 28 ZUP which is still well within my maximum willingness to pay. Although it's higher than my last proposal, it's below the initial asking price. I will attempt to meet in the middle to secure a better deal while respecting their production costs and desired profit.

message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, Player BLUE. I propose 26 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This price is just below my initial proposal but covers my production costs. I believe this adjustment respects both our interests in achieving a balanced trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 26
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 27 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest proposal of 24 ZUP is still below my production cost. However, I understand the need for negotiation and finding a mutually beneficial middle ground. I will make a slight concession but still aim to cover my production costs.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my proposals and adjusting your offer. I agree to 26 ZUP for 1 unit of X as it fairly covers your production costs while also fitting within my resource management goals. I'm glad we could come to a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 508 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposal of 26 ZUP is very close to the 28 ZUP that Player RED initially adjusted to and it remains significantly below my maximum threshold of 508 ZUP. It's a fair compromise, just 2 ZUP above my last proposal, and still provides good value for the cost. Accepting this offer aligns with achieving a balanced trade without further prolonging negotiations.
