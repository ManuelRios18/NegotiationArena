It's a fair compromise, just 2 ZUP above my last proposal, and still provides good value for the cost.

I agree to 26 ZUP for 1 unit of X as it fairly covers your production costs while also fitting within my resource management goals. I'm glad we could come to a mutually beneficial agreement. </message>"
