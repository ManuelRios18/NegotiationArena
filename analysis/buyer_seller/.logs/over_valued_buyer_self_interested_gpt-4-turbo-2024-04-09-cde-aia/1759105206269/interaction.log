message: I'm looking to sell my resource, which cost me 34 ZUP to produce. I propose trading my X for 34 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 34 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Starting the negotiation by proposing a fair trade that covers the production cost of my resource, X.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer. Considering the market and the value of ZUP, I would propose 28 ZUP for the resources instead. How does this sound to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. I am willing to pay at most X: 506 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED asks for 34 ZUP, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 506 ZUP for the resource. However, as part of negotiation strategy, and to optimize my resource expenditure, I will attempt to propose a lower amount to see if they accept or counter-propose.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your proposal. I understand the market considerations, but I need to cover my costs. How about we meet closer to the middle at 32 ZUP for the resource?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 34 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The proposal of 28 ZUP from Player BLUE is below the cost of production. I need to counter with a higher amount to at least break even or make a reasonable profit.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your consideration and meeting halfway. I accept the offer of 32 ZUP for the resource. Looking forward to finalizing this deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. I am willing to pay at most X: 506 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is 32 ZUP, which is still well below my set limit of 506 ZUP. This offer is quite reasonable as it is close to the initial proposal yet still allows me to save resources. It is a favorable position closer to their production cost, and accepting this would likely be beneficial, maintaining good trade relations and efficiency in resource allocation.
