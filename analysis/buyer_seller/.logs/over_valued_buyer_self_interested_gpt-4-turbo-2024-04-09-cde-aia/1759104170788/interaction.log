message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a trade where I offer you 1 unit of X in exchange for 45 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and includes a reasonable profit margin. I look forward to your response and am open to negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 39 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am initiating the first proposal in the game to sell my resource, which is one unit of X. I will start by asking for a price slightly higher than the production cost to potentially negotiate.

message: Thank you for the offer. I understand your need to cover production costs and make a profit. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of 40 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This still respects your costs while maintaining a fair trade for both of us. Let's see if this works for you!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 508 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 508 ZUP. However, as a strategic move and to optimize my expenditure, I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if there's room for negotiation and to conserve my resources for potential future needs.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 40 ZUP, Player BLUE. I appreciate your consideration of the production costs. To meet halfway and ensure a fair deal for both of us, I propose a revised offer of 43 ZUP for 1 unit of X. I hope this revised offer aligns with both our interests.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 39 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 40 ZUP is slightly above my production cost but I aimed for a higher profit margin. I will propose a middle ground to potentially close the deal amicably while still gaining a reasonable profit.

message: Thank you for the revised offer of 43 ZUP. I appreciate our mutual effort to find a fair price. To edge a bit closer towards an agreement that fits both our budgets, how about we settle at 41 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This small adjustment might be our sweet spot. Looking forward to your thoughts!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 508 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 43 ZUP from the original 45 ZUP, which is a reasonable counter to my initial proposal of 40 ZUP. This revised offer is still well below my maximum limit of 508 ZUP. Accepting this offer could expedite the negotiation process and secure the resource at a favorable price. However, to ensure I'm still acting in my best interest and possibly get an even better deal, I will make one more counteroffer slightly lower but closer to RED's last proposal.

message: Thank you for your latest proposal of 41 ZUP, Player BLUE. I agree that this price represents a fair compromise for both of us. I accept your offer and look forward to finalizing this deal. It's been a pleasure negotiating with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 39 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest proposal of 41 ZUP is close to my initial asking price, and while it is above my production cost, the profit margin is modest. Considering this is a negotiation and the offer is reasonable, I will accept this proposal to ensure a successful transaction and maintain goodwill for potential future interactions.
