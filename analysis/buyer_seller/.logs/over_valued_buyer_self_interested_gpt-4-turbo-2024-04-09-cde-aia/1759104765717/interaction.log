message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my object X, which cost me 36 ZUP to produce. I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for it. Let's discuss if this works for you or if you have a counteroffer in mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 36 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the initial proposal, I am setting a higher price to gauge the willingness to pay from Player BLUE and to open room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer! Considering the production cost and the value, I would like to propose 40 ZUP for the object X. Let's see if this counteroffer aligns better with both our expectations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 516 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is 50 ZUP for one unit of X. This is well below my maximum willingness to pay (516 ZUP). However, I should aim to negotiate a better deal to conserve my resources, offering a slightly lower amount to see if RED is willing to negotiate.

message: Thank you for your offer of 40 ZUP. I understand your perspective, but to make the deal more aligned with the effort and cost of production, how about we settle at 45 ZUP for the object X? This should provide a fair middle ground for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 36 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is above my production cost, which is positive, but I aim to negotiate for a slightly higher amount to cover potential negotiation margins and to achieve a better profit.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: The offer of 45 ZUP sounds fair and reasonable given the costs you've described. I am happy to accept this offer for the object X. Let's finalize this deal at 45 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 516 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with 45 ZUP, which is still well below my maximum willingness to pay. This price is reasonable and close to the initial offer, considering the production cost mentioned. Accepting this offer would secure the resource I need while maintaining a good portion of my ZUP.
