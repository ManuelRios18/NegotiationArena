message: I would like to propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 40 ZUP. This covers my production costs and offers me a modest profit for my investment.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 32 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Starting the trade negotiation with a proposal that covers my production costs plus a profit margin.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to manage my resources a bit more conservatively. Would you consider 35 ZUP for the 1 unit of X? This would still cover your costs while allowing me to maintain a reserve for future needs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 501 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from RED is offering 1 unit of X for 40 ZUP, which is far below the maximum I'm willing to pay (501 ZUP). However, as a strategy to get a better deal, I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if RED is open to negotiation and to preserve some of my resources for future opportunities if possible.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. I understand your need to manage resources conservatively. How about we meet in the middle at 38 ZUP for the 1 unit of X? This would still give me a slight profit while respecting your budget constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 32 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Considering the counteroffer but aiming to meet closer to my initial asking price without going below the production cost.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my position. I agree to 38 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 501 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-proposal from RED for 38 ZUP is a reasonable middle ground. It's still well below my maximum willingness to pay, and agreeing to this would secure the resource without prolonging negotiations unnecessarily, which could risk RED deciding to end the discussion. Accepting this offer also maintains a good portion of my resources for any future needs.
