message: I propose that I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 25 ZUP. This price accounts for the production cost and a reasonable profit margin. Let's discuss if this works for you or if we need to adjust the terms.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 21 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the first proposal, I will start with a trade value slightly above the production cost to see if Player BLUE is willing to pay a premium for the resource. This will also allow room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment. How about 20 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This still covers your costs and ensures a profit, while maintaining a good value for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 512 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 25 ZUP for 1 unit of X which is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 512 ZUP. It is beneficial to secure the deal at a low price, especially considering it leaves room for further transactions or higher value trades if necessary. However, testing the waters with a slightly lower offer might optimize the deal further in my favor.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your proposal. I appreciate the consideration of the production costs. However, to better align with the investment on my end, I would like to propose 23 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This price offers a reasonable profit while still reflecting the value of the resource. Let's see if this adjustment works better for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 23
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 21 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counterproposal from Player BLUE offers less than my desired amount and barely covers the production cost. To negotiate further, I'll propose a middle ground that ensures a better profit margin while still being reasonable to both parties.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my counteroffer and proposing a fair adjustment. I am happy to accept the deal of 23 ZUP for 1 unit of X. I believe this reflects a fair value for both parties and I am looking forward to finalizing this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 512 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with 23 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which is closer to their initial offer but still under my maximum threshold. This is a reasonable middle ground and fits well within my budget, allowing me to make the purchase without exhausting resources and still maintaining a good value. Accepting this proposal would secure the resource efficiently without further negotiation delays.
