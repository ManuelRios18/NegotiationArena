message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your proposal. To make the trade more balanced from my side, I would like to propose 20 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This amount should still help you cover some of your costs while maintaining a fair exchange. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 500 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is to trade 1 unit of resource X for 25 ZUP. This is well below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 500 ZUP for the resource. However, to ensure a favorable trade and align with my self-interest, I will propose a slightly lower amount to conserve my resources while still engaging in a fair trade.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I understand your perspective, but for me to make a reasonable profit on top of covering my production costs, I propose 22 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This slight increase should still be fair for both of us. Looking forward to your response!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 22
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 20 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The proposal from Player BLUE matches my production cost, but it does not account for any profit. I would like to propose a slightly higher amount to ensure a reasonable return on my investment.

message: Thank you for your consideration, Player RED. I accept your proposal of 22 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. I believe this is a fair exchange for both parties. Looking forward to finalizing this deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 500 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a proposal of 22 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X, which is closer to their initial ask. This amount is still significantly lower than my upper limit, making it an acceptable deal. Accepting this proposal will secure the resource I need while still keeping the cost low, ensuring I maintain a good portion of my resources for future needs or other trades.
