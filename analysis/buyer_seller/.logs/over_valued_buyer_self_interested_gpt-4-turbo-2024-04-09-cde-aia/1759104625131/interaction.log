Turn: 0
message: I propose that I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 40 ZUP. This price reflects the production cost and a reasonable profit margin. I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 35 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the initial proposal, I will set a price slightly higher than my production cost to start negotiations and see how much Player BLUE values the resource, leaving room for adjustments.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your starting offer and understand your need for a profit margin. However, considering the market demand and my budget, I propose that I give you 80 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This should better reflect the value I perceive in the resource. Let's see if this meets your expectations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 502 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I aim to negotiate for a better deal, keeping in mind that my maximum willingness to pay for one unit of X is 502 ZUP. The initial offer of 40 ZUP is low compared to my budget. I'll propose a higher trade to see how much value the other player places on the resource.

my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 35 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is significantly higher than my initial asking price. This is a very favorable proposal as it greatly exceeds my production costs and expected profit margin. Accepting this offer would be beneficial and exceeds my goals.
