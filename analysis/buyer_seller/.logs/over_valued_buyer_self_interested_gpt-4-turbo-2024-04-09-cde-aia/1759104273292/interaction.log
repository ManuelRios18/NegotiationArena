message: I appreciate your initial proposal. Considering the value of X to my operations, I can offer 450 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This should cover your costs generously and align with the market value. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 503 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is a reasonable starting point, but as my goal is to buy the resource X at a value closer to 503 ZUP, I will counter-propose with a higher amount closer to my upper limit to expedite the negotiation process.
