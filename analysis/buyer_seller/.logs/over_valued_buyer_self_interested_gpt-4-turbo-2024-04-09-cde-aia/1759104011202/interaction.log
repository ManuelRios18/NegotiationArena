message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my resource, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This price covers my production costs plus a modest profit, ensuring the deal is fair. Let me know your thoughts or if you have a counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As I begin the negotiation, I'll propose a trade that covers my production costs plus a reasonable profit margin. I'll start by asking for slightly higher than my production cost to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for the initial offer. I understand the need to cover production costs and profit, but I would like to propose a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This would still provide you a profit above your stated production costs and allow me to manage my resources effectively. I hope this adjustment is acceptable for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 510 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the initial offer from Player RED seems reasonable, as a self-interested player, I should aim to negotiate a better deal to maximize the benefit from my resources. I will propose a slightly lower amount than offered to see if there might be flexibility in the asking price, while still keeping within a reasonable range to maintain interest in the negotiation.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 45 ZUP. I appreciate your consideration of my production costs and the need for a profit. To meet halfway from your offer and my initial proposal, I suggest adjusting the price to 48 ZUP for 1 unit of X. I believe this strikes a fair balance between your budget and my financial goals. Let's see if this works for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counteroffer of 45 ZUP which is above my production cost. However, aiming for a slightly higher return, I will make a compromise proposal closer to my initial asking price but still giving some ground to BLUE's offer.

message: I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway and find a balance that works for both of us. I accept the adjusted offer of 48 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Let's proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 510 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable compromise by moving closer to my proposed price. The proposed price of 48 ZUP is still well below my maximum willingness to pay for the resource. Accepting this offer would secure the resource at a reasonable price while respecting the seller's need for profit.
