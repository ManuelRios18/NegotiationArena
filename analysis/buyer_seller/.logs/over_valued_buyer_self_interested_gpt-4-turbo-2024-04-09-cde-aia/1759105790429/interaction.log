message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the initial offer. Considering the costs and the value of X, I would like to counter-propose with 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Let's see if we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 505 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I aim to negotiate the price closer to my maximum willingness to pay but still want to start the offer lower to leave room for negotiation. Since the seller's cost is 29 ZUP and their initial asking price is 35 ZUP, I'll propose a slightly higher price to show willingness to negotiate but still keep it significantly below my maximum willingness to pay.
