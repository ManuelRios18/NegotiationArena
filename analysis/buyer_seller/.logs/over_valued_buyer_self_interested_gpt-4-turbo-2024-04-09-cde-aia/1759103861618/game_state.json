Given that this is my third proposal and the price is reasonable, I think it's advantageous to accept this offer. This allows me to secure the resource while staying well below my maximum budget. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>\n<message> I think 33 ZUP is a fair compromise.
