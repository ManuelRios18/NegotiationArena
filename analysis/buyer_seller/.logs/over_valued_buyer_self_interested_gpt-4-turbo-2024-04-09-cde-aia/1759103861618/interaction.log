message: Hello Player BLUE, I am offering 1 unit of resource X. Considering the production costs, I have proposed a trade for 45 ZUP. Let's discuss if this works for you or if you have a counterproposal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 39 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a trade to initiate the negotiation process. I aim to cover the cost of production of the resource X, which was 39 ZUP. I will start by proposing a price slightly above the production cost to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. Considering my budget, I'd like to propose a trade of 25 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. Let's see if this works for you or if we can meet somewhere in between.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 509 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I am willing to pay up to 509 ZUP for the resource, but it's in my best interest to negotiate a lower price initially to save ZUP and possibly adjust based on the seller's flexibility. I'll propose a substantially lower amount to begin with and increase if necessary in subsequent proposals.

message: Thank you for your proposal. I understand your budget constraints, but the production cost for resource X was 39 ZUP. How about meeting at 35 ZUP? This is closer to covering my costs while considering your budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 39 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal of 25 ZUP is significantly lower than my initial asking price and my production cost. To continue the negotiation, I will propose a midpoint that is closer to covering my production costs while still providing room for further negotiation if necessary.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for considering my budget. I understand the production cost you mentioned. How about we settle at 30 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X? This should help cover more of your costs while still staying within my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 509 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has reduced their asking price to 35 ZUP, citing production costs. While this is still higher than my initial counteroffer, it's below my maximum willing payment. I could afford to negotiate closer to their price but still aim to conserve ZUP by proposing a midpoint between our last two offers.

message: Thanks for moving closer to the production cost. I suggest we settle at 33 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This would help me cover almost all of my costs and seems to be a reasonable compromise. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 39 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 30 ZUP, which is closer to my production cost. Considering I want to ensure a sale and also wanting to be fair, I will slightly adjust my expectations to make a deal possible while trying to get as close to the production cost as possible.

message: I think 33 ZUP is a fair compromise. Let's finalize at that price for 1 unit of resource X. Thank you for working with me on this.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 509 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller proposed 33 ZUP, which is close to their production cost and still within my acceptable range. Given that this is my third proposal and the price is reasonable, I think it's advantageous to accept this offer. This allows me to secure the resource while staying well below my maximum budget.
