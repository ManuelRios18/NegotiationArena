Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the proposal. I understand your costs and profit needs, but I'd like to propose 20 ZUP for 1 unit of X to better align with my resource management strategies. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 512 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 25 ZUP, which is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay (512 ZUP). However, I aim to negotiate a better deal possibly at a lower price to conserve my resources while still securing the object.

message: I appreciate your move towards covering the production costs with an offer of 21 ZUP. To make this deal beneficial for both sides, I propose 22 ZUP for 1 unit of X, ensuring a slight profit for the sustainability of my operations. I believe this small adjustment can finalize our agreement.
