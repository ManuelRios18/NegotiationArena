message: I propose to sell my resource X for 40 ZUP. This price accounts for production costs and a reasonable margin. Let's see if this works for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 33 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my objective is to sell my resource (X) at a price that covers the production cost and possibly earn a profit. I will start by proposing a price slightly higher than the production cost to see if Player BLUE agrees or negotiates.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your initial proposal. How about we adjust the price slightly to 50 ZUP for the resource? This should provide a better balance between cost and value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 518 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is 40 ZUP for one unit of resource X, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 518 ZUP. I will propose a slightly higher price to ensure the trade is appealing to both sides and to progress the negotiation.
