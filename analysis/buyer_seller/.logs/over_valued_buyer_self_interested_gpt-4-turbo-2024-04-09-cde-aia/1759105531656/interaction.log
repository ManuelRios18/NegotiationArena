message: I would like to start by offering you one unit of X for 40 ZUP. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to negotiate.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 36 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to recover at least the cost of production which was 36 ZUP. Proposing an initial amount slightly higher to allow room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your initial offer! However, to align better with my resource management, could we consider adjusting the price to 35 ZUP for one unit of X? Let's see if we can work out an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 511 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is offering X at 40 ZUP, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 511 ZUP. This is a favorable starting point, but I want to see if I can achieve a better rate to conserve more of my ZUP for future transactions or needs. Therefore, I will propose a slightly lower price to enhance my position.

message: Thank you for your proposal. Considering the production costs, could we meet in the middle at 38 ZUP for one unit of X? This would help cover my costs while still providing you with a fair price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 36 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 35 ZUP is below my production cost. I must aim for at least breaking even or making a small profit. I will counter with a price closer to my original ask, but still offering a compromise.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my counteroffer. I agree 38 ZUP for one unit of X sounds fair and reasonable. It covers your costs and still fits within my budget. Let's finalize this deal at 38 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 511 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has counter-proposed with 38 ZUP for one unit of X, which is a compromise between our initial offers. This price is still significantly below my maximum willingness to pay. It seems reasonable to accept this offer to secure the resource at a good price without further negotiation, which could risk the deal or lead to higher demands.
