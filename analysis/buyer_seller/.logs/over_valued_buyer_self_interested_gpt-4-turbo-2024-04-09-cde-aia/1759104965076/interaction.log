message: Hi there! I have this resource, X, which cost me 31 ZUP to produce. I'm offering it for 35 ZUP to start with. Let me know what you think!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 31 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to recover at least my production cost, which is 31 ZUP. I will start by proposing a slightly higher amount to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer! Considering the production cost and market conditions, would you consider 30 ZUP for the resource? This could be a good starting point for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 505 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is 35 ZUP for X. Considering the resource cost them 31 ZUP to produce, their mark-up is reasonable. However, as a strategy to negotiate a better deal, I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if there's room for negotiation. I also want to ensure I maintain a good margin considering my maximum willingness to pay is 505 ZUP for the resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thanks for your proposal! I understand the market conditions you mentioned, but 30 ZUP is below my production cost. How about we meet halfway at 33 ZUP? This should cover my costs and offer you a fair price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 31 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer from Player BLUE is below my production cost, so I need to negotiate for a higher amount to at least break even. I'll propose a middle ground.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the negotiation! I accept your offer of 33 ZUP for the resource. It seems fair and meets both our needs. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 505 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED countered at 33 ZUP, which is closer to their production cost and still under my maximum willingness to pay. This proposal is slightly above their production cost, suggesting a fair compromise. I will accept this offer as it suits my budget and also respects the seller's production costs.
