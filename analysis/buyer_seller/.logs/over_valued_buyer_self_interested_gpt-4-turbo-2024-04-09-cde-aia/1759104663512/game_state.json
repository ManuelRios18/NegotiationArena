This is very close to our last counteroffer and still well within the budget I have for purchasing resources. This price is fair, considering it matches their production costs, and it's beneficial for establishing a long-term relationship. Accepting this offer would be reasonable and advantageous. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>\n<message> I appreciate your flexibility and understanding in reaching a fair price that supports both our needs.
