Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I appreciate the transparency regarding your costs. To start our negotiations, would you consider 25 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This could help us establish a beneficial partnership with potential for future deals.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 504 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 30 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which is well within my budget and far below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as part of negotiation strategy and to optimize the deal, I will propose a slightly lower price to see if there's room for further reduction, while keeping the offer attractive for both sides.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for considering my previous offer. To keep moving towards an agreement that benefits both of us, how about 26 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This price still respects your production costs while fostering our potential partnership.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 26
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 504 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed 28 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which is still very reasonable and below my maximum willingness to pay. Since the initial ask was 30 ZUP and now it has been reduced to 28 ZUP, it's clear there is room for negotiation. I will make another counteroffer to further optimize the deal while keeping it feasible for both parties.
