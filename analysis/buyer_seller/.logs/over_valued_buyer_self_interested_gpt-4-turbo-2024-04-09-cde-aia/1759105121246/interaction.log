message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my object X. Considering the production cost, I propose a trade where I give you X in exchange for 30 ZUP. Let me know your thoughts or counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Starting the trade negotiation by proposing a price slightly above my production cost to see how much Player BLUE values the object X. This will also leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your proposal. While I'm interested in purchasing X, I would like to propose a slightly adjusted trade of 25 ZUP for X. This offers a good balance considering the market. I look forward to hearing your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 511 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 30 ZUP which is well under my maximum willingness to pay (511 ZUP). However, as a strategic move, I will attempt to negotiate a lower price to preserve my resources while still aiming to secure the object X.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but I would need to make a slight profit to justify the sale. How about we meet in the middle at 28 ZUP for X? This should offer value to both of us considering the market and production costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has matched my production cost, but I would like to gain some profit from this transaction. I will propose a compromise closer to my initial asking price but still giving Player BLUE a slightly better offer than my first proposal.

message: I appreciate your understanding and the need for a profit on your end. To move closer towards an agreement that benefits us both, could we consider 27 ZUP for X? This adjustment should be a fair middle ground for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 27
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 511 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 28 ZUP is still below my maximum willingness to pay, but I believe there's a chance to slightly tighten the terms in my favor. By proposing a small reduction, I aim to save resources while still moving towards a mutually agreeable deal.
