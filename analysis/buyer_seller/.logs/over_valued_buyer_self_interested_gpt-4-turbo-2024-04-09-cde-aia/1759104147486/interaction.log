message: Thank you for the proposal. I would like to counter with 30 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This amount, I believe, is more aligned with the current market trends and also accounts for a fair trade agreement. Looking forward to your thoughts!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 512 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 35 ZUP which is well below my maximum willingness to pay. However, to optimize the trade, I will try to propose a slightly lower amount to conserve my resources while still engaging in a fair trade.

message: I appreciate your flexibility and understand the need to cover costs while ensuring a fair deal. The price of 33 ZUP is acceptable to me, and I'm happy to proceed at this rate. Let's finalize this deal at 33 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Looking forward to future dealings!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 512 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 33 ZUP, which is still well under my maximum threshold. This counteroffer is closer to their initial proposal but still offers savings on my end. Accepting this offer would secure the resource at a reasonable price without further negotiation, preserving my ability to propose in future transactions if needed.
