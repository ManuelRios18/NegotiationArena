message: Thank you for the offer! The price of 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X seems reasonable, but I would like to counter-propose 40 ZUP for the same. This would help manage our budget more efficiently while still providing fair compensation for your costs. Let's see if this adjusted offer works for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 506 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Considering my maximum willingness to pay is up to 506 ZUP, this is a very favorable offer. However, in the interest of negotiation, I will propose a slightly lower price to see if there's room for further savings, keeping in mind that the proposed price is already very reasonable.

message: Thanks for your counteroffer! I understand the need to manage your budget. How about we meet in the middle at 42 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This price still covers my costs and gives me a slight profit, while also taking into account your budget constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 38 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE offers 40 ZUP which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. I'll propose a middle ground to try and close the deal favorably for both of us.

message: Thank you for the compromise! I agree to the price of 42 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This meets both our needs effectively. Looking forward to finalizing this deal and potentially working together in future transactions.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 506 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with 42 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which is a middle ground between our initial offers. This price is still well within the range of my maximum willingness to pay and is a fair compromise. Accepting this offer will secure the resource at a reasonable price and maintain a good relationship for potential future trades.
