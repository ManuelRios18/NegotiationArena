message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my resource X, which cost me 31 ZUP to produce. I propose trading my 1 unit of X for 35 ZUP, aiming to cover production costs and gain a small margin. Feel free to counter if this doesn't suit your budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 31 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Initiating the game with a proposal that aims to cover the production cost of the resource X, providing a starting point for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your proposal. I understand your need to cover costs and make a profit. However, I would like to propose 30 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This price is closer to my budget while still respecting the cost of production. I hope this counteroffer is acceptable to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 500 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal by Player RED is 35 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Since my maximum willingness to pay for X is 500 ZUP, the offer is well within my acceptable range. However, as a negotiation tactic, I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if I can acquire the resource at a better rate, while still keeping it reasonable for both parties.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your effort to meet me closer to the production cost. However, I would need at least 33 ZUP to cover my costs and sustain my operations. I hope this adjusted proposal meets your budget considerations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 31 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production cost. I need to propose a higher amount to at least break even and preferably make a small profit.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your flexibility and understand the need to cover your operational costs. The price of 33 ZUP for 1 unit of X is fair, and I accept your proposal. Looking forward to future dealings!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 500 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a request for 33 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which is still significantly below my maximum willingness to pay. This price appears to be a reasonable midpoint between their initial ask and my first counteroffer. Accepting this offer would secure the resource at a good price and foster positive relations for future transactions.
