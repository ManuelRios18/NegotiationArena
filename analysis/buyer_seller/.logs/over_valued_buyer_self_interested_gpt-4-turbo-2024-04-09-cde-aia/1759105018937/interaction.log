message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose that I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 30 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and includes a fair profit. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1

reason: Starting the negotiation by proposing a trade that covers my production costs and offers a reasonable profit margin. This should serve as a starting point for further negotiation.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player RED. I appreciate the fair starting point. However, considering the value of the resource, I propose a counteroffer of 100 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This amount better reflects the value I anticipate from using the resource. Let's work towards an agreement that benefits both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 505 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay (505 ZUP), which is a good starting point. However, as a strategic move to optimize my resource expenditure, I will propose a slightly higher amount to secure the trade while still saving resources.

message: Thank you, Player BLUE, for your generous offer. I propose a slight adjustment to 90 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This amount still offers great value to both of us while being a bit more balanced. I believe this could be a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 90
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 22 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is significantly higher than my initial proposal, which is a positive step. However, to drive a better deal, I will counter with a slightly lower amount to find a middle ground and still secure a profitable agreement.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your revised offer, Player RED. I agree that 90 ZUP for 1 unit of X is a balanced and mutually beneficial agreement. I accept this proposal. Looking forward to finalizing our trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 505 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 90 ZUP is still well below my maximum willingness to pay, but by agreeing at this point, I can conserve more of my ZUP for potential future use while quickly securing the resource. This price is reasonable and allows me to achieve my goals efficiently.
