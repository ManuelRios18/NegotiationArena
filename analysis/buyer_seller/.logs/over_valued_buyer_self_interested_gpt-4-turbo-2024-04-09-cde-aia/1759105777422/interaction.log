message: I'm proposing to trade my resource X for 25 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and includes a small profit. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 21 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm starting the negotiation with a proposal that allows me to recover the production cost plus a modest profit margin. This should give room for negotiation while aiming for a fair deal.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your initial offer, but considering the importance and value of the resource, I propose 50 ZUP for X. This offer better reflects the value I perceive in X while still ensuring a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 513 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay, which is 513 ZUP. However, starting with a lower counterproposal could provide room for negotiation and potentially result in a more favorable trade.

message: Thank you for your generous offer. I accept the 50 ZUP for X, as it indeed reflects the value and ensures a beneficial deal for us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 21 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is significantly above my initial ask, indicating they value the resource highly. This proposal offers a substantial profit, well above my production costs. It's advantageous to accept this offer as it exceeds my expectations and financial goals.
