message: I'm offering 1 unit of X for 35 ZUP. The production cost was 29 ZUP, so this price includes a fair profit margin. Let's discuss if this works for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 29 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Starting the trade negotiation by proposing a reasonable price that allows me to recover the production costs and gain some profit. Setting the initial price slightly higher might give room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the initial offer. Considering the general market trends and aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement, could we consider slightly adjusting the price to 32 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This could help in setting a precedent for future transactions as well.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 503 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 35 ZUP for 1 unit of X from Player RED seems reasonable, especially considering the production cost of 29 ZUP. However, as a strategic move, I will propose a slightly lower price to see if there is room for negotiation and to ensure I maximize my resources effectively while still making a fair deal.

message: Thank you for your proposal. I appreciate your perspective on market trends. Could we meet in the middle at 34 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This would still provide a fair deal for both sides, accounting for production costs and future relationship building.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 29 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Acknowledging the counteroffer made by Player BLUE. Considering the initial cost of production, I propose a compromise that still allows me to maintain a reasonable profit margin while moving closer to the amount offered by Player BLUE.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering the adjustment. Meeting at 34 ZUP seems fair and reasonable, and I believe it sets a good foundation for our future interactions. I accept this proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 503 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 34 ZUP for 1 unit of X is quite close to the initial proposal. Although it is slightly higher than my last proposal, it is still well within a reasonable range considering my maximum willingness to pay up to 503 ZUP for the resources. Meeting in the middle demonstrates good faith and helps to establish a positive ongoing relationship, which could be beneficial for future dealings.
