message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a trade where I give you 1 X in exchange for 25 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and provides a reasonable profit margin. I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiation. Looking forward to your response!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 20 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Initiating the trade with a starting proposal that covers the cost of production plus a profit margin to make the trade appealing.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the proposal! I appreciate the fair starting point. To better align with my budget, I'd like to propose a small adjustment. How about I give you 20 ZUP for 1 X? This still covers a significant portion of your costs while helping me manage my resources effectively. Let me know what you think!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 501 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED for 25 ZUP is considerably lower than my maximum willingness to pay, which is 501 ZUP. However, it's beneficial to attempt improving the deal slightly on my end to conserve resources while maintaining a fair trade.

message: Thank you for your proposal and understanding of the costs involved. I appreciate your budget considerations. Let's meet halfway. How about I give you 1 X for 22 ZUP? This allows for a slight profit on my end while still being mindful of your resources. Does this work better for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 22
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 20 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Considering the other player's budget constraints, I will propose a compromise that still allows for a slight profit above the production cost to justify the sale.

message: Thank you for your consideration and the counterproposal. I agree that 22 ZUP for 1 X is a fair price that respects both our positions. Let's finalize this trade at 22 ZUP. Looking forward to future dealings!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 501 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counterproposal of 22 ZUP is close to my initial revised offer and still well below my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would secure the necessary resources while maintaining a significant amount of my budget. It's a reasonable compromise that balances cost with benefit.
