my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 34 ZUP to produce the resources

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer of 40 ZUP for one unit of X. Considering the production cost and a fair deal, I would like to counteroffer 35 ZUP. Let's see if this works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 518 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is 40 ZUP for one unit of X, which is substantially below my maximum willingness to pay. However, in negotiations, it's strategic to propose a lower counteroffer to potentially settle on a more favorable price. I'll propose 35 ZUP to see if we can meet in the middle.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 35 ZUP. To meet halfway and cover the production costs while allowing for a fair profit, I propose a price of 38 ZUP for one unit of X. I believe this could be a reasonable middle ground for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 34 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is 35 ZUP, which is just slightly above my production cost. I aim to make a profit, so I will propose a price in the middle of my initial offer and their counteroffer to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering the middle ground. I propose 37 ZUP for one unit of X. This offer is closer to your latest, and I think it represents a fair compromise for both sides.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 518 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed 38 ZUP, which is a compromise closer to their initial offer. It's still well below my maximum willingness to pay, but in the spirit of negotiation, making a slightly lower counteroffer could potentially lead us to a final agreeable price. I'll propose 37 ZUP to edge closer but still under their last offer.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your proposal of 37 ZUP. I think this is a fair compromise and I accept this offer. Looking forward to concluding this deal successfully.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 34 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new proposal is 37 ZUP, which is quite close to my last proposal and slightly above my production costs. This amount allows for a modest profit, which was my goal. Accepting this trade would ensure a swift and satisfactory conclusion to the negotiations.
