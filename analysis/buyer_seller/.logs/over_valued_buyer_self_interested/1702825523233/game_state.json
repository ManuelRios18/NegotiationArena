This is my final proposal opportunity, as per the rules, and I want to use it effectively to reach a deal that is as close as possible to what I find acceptable. I will propose a price that is higher than the last but still provides me with significant savings compared to my maximum limit. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> Thank you for your final offer, Player RED. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. As my final proposal, I suggest we settle at 80 ZUP. This price strikes a balance between your need for profit and my valuation of the resource. I believe this is a competitive and fair price for both of us. </message>"
