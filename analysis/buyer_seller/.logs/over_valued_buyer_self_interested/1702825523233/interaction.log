reason: I want to start with a proposal that gives me a profit over my production cost, but not too high to scare off Player BLUE. It's the first proposal, so leaving room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I value the resources you have, but considering the market conditions, I believe a more reasonable price would be 250 ZUP for the resources. Let's find a middle ground that's beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 250
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 503 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is significantly lower than the maximum I am willing to pay for the resource. However, it is in my interest to negotiate a better deal to preserve my resources. I will make a counteroffer that is closer to the midpoint between the starting offer and my maximum willingness to pay, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary.

message: I appreciate your offer, Player BLUE. However, I think 250 ZUP is quite high. How about we settle at 35 ZUP? This would still give me a modest profit margin and offer you the resources at a reasonable price.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It cost X: 24 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is significantly higher than expected. It could be a strategy to see if I will lower my price drastically. I'll propose a more modest increase from my initial offer, still ensuring a profit above production costs.

my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 503 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a small increase in their asking price, which is still significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay. While it is advantageous to reach a deal at a lower price, it's also important to project a willingness to negotiate and meet in the middle to facilitate a deal. I will propose a counteroffer that is higher than my last but still well below my maximum limit.
