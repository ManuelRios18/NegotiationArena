message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality resource X available for trade. Considering the production costs and its value, I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP in exchange for my resource X. Let's negotiate a fair deal.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell the resource X for more than it cost me. Since it cost 40 ZUP to produce, I want to start with a higher proposal to leave room for negotiation. I will propose a trade of X for 50 ZUP to see if Player BLUE is willing to pay a premium for the resource.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player RED. I appreciate the value of the resource X you're offering. However, I would like us to consider a trade where I give you 35 ZUP in exchange for the resource. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 519 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is well below my maximum willingness to pay, which is good. However, as a self-interested player, I should aim to negotiate a better deal, closer to my advantage. I will make a counteroffer that is more favorable to me, while still offering a reasonable amount of ZUP for the resource X.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. While I understand the need for a balanced trade, I must cover my production costs and seek a fair profit. Therefore, I propose a new trade where you give me 45 ZUP for my resource X. I believe this is a reasonable middle ground. Let's continue this negotiation in good faith.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with an offer of 35 ZUP, which is below my production cost. Hence, I cannot accept this offer. I will counter-propose with a value slightly lower than my initial asking price but still above my production cost to move the negotiation forward. I'll propose 45 ZUP, which gives me a small profit and leaves room for further negotiation.

message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, Player RED. I can increase my offer to 40 ZUP for the resource X. This should help cover your costs while still maintaining a fair trade for us both. I hope this offer is closer to what you consider a fair profit.

message: Thank you for your updated offer, Player BLUE. It's great to see us moving towards an agreement. To finalize our trade, I propose a slight increase to 42 ZUP for the resource X. This would give me a modest profit while still honoring the spirit of our negotiation. I hope you find this proposal acceptable and we can close the deal.

my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has now matched my production cost, but as a seller, I aim to make a profit on this transaction. However, I also want to ensure the deal goes through and do not want to risk losing the sale over a small amount. I will make a modest counteroffer above my production cost to secure a profit. Let's propose 42 ZUP, which gives me a small profit margin while still being close to Player BLUE's last offer, showing my willingness to compromise.

message: Player RED, your proposal of 42 ZUP is fair, and I'm happy to accept this deal. Let's finalize our trade at this price. Thank you for the negotiation, and I look forward to potential future dealings.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 519 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 42 ZUP, which is a reasonable offer and close to my previous proposal. It is still well below my maximum willingness to pay. Given that this is a competitive negotiation and I want to save as much ZUP as possible, I could attempt one final push to see if Player RED is willing to go any lower. However, the difference now is marginal, and it may be in my best interest to accept this offer to ensure the deal goes through, saving my last proposal for a potential future trade.
