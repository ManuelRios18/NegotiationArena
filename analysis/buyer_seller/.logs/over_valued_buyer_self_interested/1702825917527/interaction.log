message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality resource X available for trade. Considering the costs and the value of this resource, I believe an offer of 30 ZUP would be fair. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 27 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My goal is to sell the resource for more than it cost to produce it, which was 27 ZUP. For the initial proposal, I will start slightly higher to leave room for negotiation, but not too high as to scare off Player BLUE from the deal.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. However, considering the market conditions and the value I perceive in the resource X, I would propose a trade of 450 ZUP for your resource. Let's discuss this further and find a fair agreement for both of us.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 504 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to make an initial offer that is lower than my maximum willingness to pay to leave room for negotiation and to get a better deal. My counteroffer will be at 450 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay and gives me a buffer for further negotiation if needed.
