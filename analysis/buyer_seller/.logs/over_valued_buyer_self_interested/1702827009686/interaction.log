message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe that 40 ZUP is a bit steep for the starting point of our negotiations. How about we start at 20 ZUP and go from there?

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 500 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal by Player RED is far below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 500 ZUP. However, as a self-interested player, I want to negotiate the best possible deal. Therefore, I will counter with a lower offer to see if there is room for negotiation.

message: I understand your concerns about the cost, but 20 ZUP would put me at a loss. Let's meet in the middle. I propose 37 ZUP for the object X. It should cover the production costs and offer a fair deal to both of us. What do you say?

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I can't go as high as 37 ZUP, but I believe that 30 ZUP is a reasonable counteroffer that takes into account both the production costs and the value of the object. Let's finalize at this amount.

my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 500 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is still well below my maximum willingness to pay, but I believe there is still room for negotiation to lower the price further. By proposing an amount higher than my initial offer but lower than their counteroffer, I can continue the negotiation process while moving closer to a favorable price.

reason: The offer from Player BLUE is now very close to my production costs.

Considering this is my last proposal, I should aim to close the deal with this response. I will accept their offer to ensure a transaction occurs and to avoid the risk of losing the sale altogether.
