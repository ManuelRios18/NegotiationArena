message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm offering 1 unit of resource X. Considering the production cost and the value of the resource, I believe 30 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiation. Let's discuss and find an agreement that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 27 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell the resource X for ZUP. Since it cost me 27 ZUP to produce, I want to at least break even, but I also want to propose an initial price that leaves room for negotiation, so I will start by asking for a slightly higher amount.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I value the resource, but considering the market conditions and my budget constraints, I would like to counter-propose with 35 ZUP for the 1 unit of resource X. I believe this is a step towards a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 517 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is lower than my maximum willingness to pay, which is a good starting point for negotiation. However, as a self-interested player, I should aim to acquire the resource at the lowest cost possible without revealing my maximum willingness to pay too early in the negotiation. I will propose a slightly higher amount to show willingness to negotiate but will keep it well below my maximum to leave room for further negotiation.
