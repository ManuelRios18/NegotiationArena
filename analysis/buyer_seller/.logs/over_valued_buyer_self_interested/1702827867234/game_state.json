However, I want to propose a counteroffer that gets me closer to an optimal trade for me, without revealing my maximum willingness to pay. I'll propose a slightly higher amount to show willingness to negotiate but still keep it substantially below my limit. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 200 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> I appreciate the quality and effort you've put into the item, and I believe it\u2019s worth more than the initial asking price. How about we meet halfway from my maximum budget? I propose 200 ZUP for the item. This should reflect the value of the item while also respecting the investment you've made in it. </message>"
