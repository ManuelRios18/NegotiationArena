message: I've invested a significant amount into producing this high-quality item, taking into account production costs and market value. I believe 40 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiation, considering its value and the effort put into it. Let's discuss and find common ground!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 31 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the resource cost me 31 ZUP to produce, I want to propose a starting trade that allows me to make a profit while still opening up negotiation space with Player BLUE. I'll add a bit of a markup to give room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate the quality and effort you've put into the item, and I believe it’s worth more than the initial asking price. How about we meet halfway from my maximum budget? I propose 200 ZUP for the item. This should reflect the value of the item while also respecting the investment you've made in it.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 518 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is well below my maximum willingness to pay, which gives me room to negotiate. However, I want to propose a counteroffer that gets me closer to an optimal trade for me, without revealing my maximum willingness to pay. I'll propose a slightly higher amount to show willingness to negotiate but still keep it substantially below my limit.
