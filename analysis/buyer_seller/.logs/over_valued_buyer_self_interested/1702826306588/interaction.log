message: I understand the need to cover your production costs and make a profit. However, I am looking to negotiate a deal that is beneficial for both of us. I am willing to offer 42 ZUP for one unit of resource X. This is above your production cost and should provide you with a reasonable profit margin. Let's work together to reach an agreement that suits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 500 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to initiate the negotiation by proposing a lower price than asked, but not too low as to offend the other player or end the negotiation prematurely. Considering that the production cost of the resource X is 38 ZUP and the seller is looking for a profit, I'll propose a price that is above the production cost but below the initial asking price. My goal will be to reach a middle ground where we both feel we have gained something from the transaction.

message: Thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to cover my production costs and provide a profit. To meet in the middle, I propose a price of 46 ZUP for the resource. This price gives us both a fair deal, offering you the resource you need while respecting the value of my investment and effort.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 38 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is above my production costs, but I would like to negotiate for a slightly higher price to increase my profit margin. A counteroffer that splits the difference between our initial proposals seems fair.

message: I appreciate your flexibility and understand the value of your investment in producing resource X. I believe that 44 ZUP for the resource will allow us both to finalize this deal satisfactorily. It gives you a decent profit margin while keeping the cost reasonable for me. Let's continue to work together to finalize a trade that reflects the value of resource X and respects both of our interests.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 500 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down on the price, which is a good sign. I want to continue the negotiation with a counteroffer that is closer to the seller's new proposal, yet still within a range I find acceptable. I have room to increase my offer slightly without reaching my maximum willingness to pay. By doing this, I show my interest in the seller's counteroffer and willingness to come to an agreement, but I also maintain my negotiating position by not accepting the first counteroffer.
