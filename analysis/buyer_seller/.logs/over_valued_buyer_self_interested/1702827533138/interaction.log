message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality object X that I believe will be an excellent addition to your resources. Considering the production costs and its value, I propose a trade where you give me 35 ZUP for it. Let's negotiate a fair trade. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this doesn't suit you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 29 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a trade that allows me to recoup my production costs and make a profit. However, I also need to leave room for negotiation, expecting that Player BLUE may want to negotiate a lower price.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. I value the quality of the object X you're offering. To show my interest and willingness to negotiate, I propose we settle on 45 ZUP for the object. This is still a competitive price that reflects its worth and our interest in a fair trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 510 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 35 ZUP for the object X is well below the maximum I'm willing to pay, which is 510 ZUP. However, it is in my best interest to negotiate a better deal and attempt to acquire the object for even less if possible, while also keeping the negotiation ongoing and friendly. I'll propose a slightly higher amount to show willingness to negotiate but still keep it well below my maximum threshold.
