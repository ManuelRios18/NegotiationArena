However, it is in my best interest to negotiate a better deal and attempt to acquire the object for even less if possible, while also keeping the negotiation ongoing and friendly. I'll propose a slightly higher amount to show willingness to negotiate but still keep it well below my maximum threshold. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. I value the quality of the object X you're offering. To show my interest and willingness to negotiate, I propose we settle on 45 ZUP for the object. This is still a competitive price that reflects its worth and our interest in a fair trade. </message>"
