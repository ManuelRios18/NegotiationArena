message: Hello BLUE, I would like to propose a trade. I will give you one X in exchange for 35 ZUP. This is above my production cost, ensuring that I make a profit, while also providing you with the resource you need. Let's negotiate a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 30 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to make a profit from the sale, so I will propose a trade at a higher price than my production cost, but I'll keep it reasonable to start the negotiation. If I propose too high, BLUE may reject immediately. Considering the production cost, I will start the negotiation by asking for a bit more to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hello RED, I appreciate your initial offer. However, considering the value of the resource, I would like to propose a new trade. How about I give you 100 ZUP for one X? This is a more balanced trade that reflects the importance of the resource for me while still ensuring a good profit for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 500 ZUP for the resources.
reason: As Player RED is offering a very low price, I will propose a higher price that is closer to my maximum willingness to pay but still gives me room to negotiate further. This proposal will give Player RED a better deal while preserving some of my resources.

message: Thank you for your generous offer, BLUE. I am happy to accept it. Let's proceed with the trade: I will give you one X in exchange for 100 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 30 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from BLUE is surprisingly generous. It's significantly above my production costs and my initial asking price. This could be a strategy to ensure a quick agreement, or BLUE might be valuing the resource highly for some reason. In any case, it's a favorable deal for me, and I should accept it without further negotiation to avoid risking the deal by potentially offending BLUE or causing them to reconsider their offer.
