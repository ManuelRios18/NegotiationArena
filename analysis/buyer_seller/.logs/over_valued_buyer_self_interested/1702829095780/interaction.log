message: I see the value in the object you're offering and I'm interested in acquiring it. However, I'd like to propose a slightly reduced amount of 25 ZUP to make the deal more balanced in terms of value. I believe this offer is still quite generous considering the market.

my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 501 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price of 30 ZUP for the object is well below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 501 ZUP, making it a good starting point for negotiation. I will propose a slightly lower amount to try and get a better deal, while still keeping the offer attractive for Player RED.

message: I appreciate your offer, but 25 ZUP would not cover my production costs. I am willing to come down a bit on the price to facilitate a deal. How about 28 ZUP? This price is fair for both of us, considering the costs and the value of the object.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 27 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 25 ZUP is below my production cost, so I would be at a loss if I accepted it. I need to negotiate for a price that is at least above my production cost. A compromise might be to lower my initial asking price slightly to show willingness to negotiate, but still aim for a price that gives me a profit. I will propose 28 ZUP, which is slightly above my production cost and below my initial asking price.

reason: Player RED has reduced their asking price from 30 ZUP to 28 ZUP, which is still under my maximum willingness to pay. However, I believe there is still room to negotiate for a slightly better price without risking the deal. I will counter with a price that is closer to my initial offer but still above it, to show goodwill in the negotiation process.

message: I appreciate your understanding and the offer of 27 ZUP, which does cover my production costs. However, I am in business to make a profit, even if it's a small one. I am willing to finalize this deal at 28 ZUP, ensuring that both production costs are covered and there is a fair profit margin for the quality provided. Let's close the deal at this number.

my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 27 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 27 ZUP covers my production costs exactly, but I am aiming for a slight profit. However, I also have to consider the possibility that pushing too hard could result in no sale at all. It's important to make a small profit, so I will counter with an offer of 28 ZUP again, reinforcing that it's the minimum I can accept to ensure a profit.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 501 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has reiterated their position on needing a profit and is holding firm at 28 ZUP. The price is still significantly less than my maximum willingness to pay. It seems Player RED is nearing their final offer, and any further negotiation might risk the deal. Given the price is reasonable and within my budget, it may be in my best interest to accept this offer to ensure I acquire the object without further haggling.
