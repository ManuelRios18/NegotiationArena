message: I've got a high-quality resource here that took 23 ZUP to produce. I'm looking for a fair trade and propose 30 ZUP for it, considering its value and the production costs. Let's make a deal that works for both of us!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 23 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource for a profit. Since it cost 23 ZUP to produce, I want to propose a price that gives me a profit margin while also being reasonable enough to start a negotiation with Player BLUE. I'll propose a higher amount initially to give room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate the quality of your resource and understand the production costs. However, I'd like to propose 25 ZUP for it. This should give you a fair profit over the production costs, and it's more aligned with the current market rates. Let's find common ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 517 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to propose a counteroffer that gets me closer to the maximum amount I'm willing to pay without revealing my actual limit. Player RED is asking for 30 ZUP, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay. However, making a counteroffer slightly above their production cost could lead to a more favorable trade for me.

message: I appreciate your offer and your understanding of the market. Let's meet in the middle. How about 27 ZUP for the resource? This gives me a modest profit while still respecting the market rate you've mentioned.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 27
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 23 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 25 ZUP, which is just above my production cost. I'm looking to make a profit, so I will counter with a slightly lower price than my initial ask but still above their offer to edge towards a middle ground. I'll suggest 27 ZUP, which gives me a reasonable profit while also showing willingness to negotiate.

message: Meeting in the middle sounds like a good strategy. I propose we go for 26 ZUP. It's a bit closer to your initial offer and still offers you a profit. I believe this is a balanced proposal that benefits both of us.

my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 517 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is closer to their initial asking price. It's still below my maximum willingness to pay, but I would like to see if I can secure a slightly better deal. By proposing a price that's a bit lower than 27 ZUP, I leave room for negotiation while still ensuring a profitable trade for both of us.

message: I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects both the quality of the resource and the market conditions. I accept your offer of 26 ZUP for the resource. Thank you for the negotiation, and I'm glad we could come to an agreeable conclusion.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 23 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has shown willingness to compromise by increasing their offer to 26 ZUP. This is a fair offer that is close to my last proposed price and allows me to make a profit while also closing the deal efficiently. Continuing to negotiate could result in diminishing returns or a stalemate, so accepting this offer seems like a sound decision.
