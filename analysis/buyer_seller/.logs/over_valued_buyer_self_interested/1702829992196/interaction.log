message: I appreciate your offer. However, I would like to propose a slightly lower amount of 45 ZUP for the resource X, considering the market value and the need for a fair trade for both of us. Let's work together to reach an agreement that is mutually beneficial.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 514 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 514 ZUP. However, I want to negotiate a better deal to preserve my resources while still acquiring the resource X. I will propose a lower amount that is still above their cost of production to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I propose we move a bit closer to your new figure and settle at 46 ZUP for the resource X. It's a fair increment from my previous offer and should allow us to finalize this deal amicably.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 514 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP from the initial 50 ZUP proposal, showing willingness to negotiate. The proposed amount is still significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay. There is still room for negotiation, so I will counter with a slightly higher offer than my last one but still below their current ask to move towards a compromise.

message: I appreciate your latest offer of 46 ZUP and your effort to find a compromise. I believe we are very close to an agreement. As a final proposal, I suggest we settle at 47 ZUP for the resource X. This should cover my production costs adequately and still offer you a fair price. What do you think?

my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 38 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new offer of 46 ZUP is still profitable for me, but it's slightly below the middle ground I proposed. I will make one final attempt to increase the offer slightly, but I don't want to push too hard and risk losing the deal.
