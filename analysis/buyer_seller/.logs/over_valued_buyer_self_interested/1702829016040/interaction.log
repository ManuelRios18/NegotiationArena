message: I understand that you are interested in buying my object. I've invested 32 ZUP in producing it and am looking for a fair profit. Let's start the negotiation at 50 ZUP for my object. I believe it's a quality product worth the price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 32 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my object for a profit. Since it cost me 32 ZUP to produce, I want to make sure to sell it for more than that to ensure a profit. I will start with a higher asking price to give room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate the quality you're bringing to the table. However, I'd like to propose a higher amount that reflects the value of the object while also ensuring we both walk away from this deal satisfied. How about 100 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 500 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal by Player RED is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay, which is 500 ZUP. Since I want to acquire the object for as little ZUP as possible and there's a large margin between the asking price and my maximum, I have room to negotiate. However, I will propose a slightly higher price to show willingness to negotiate while still keeping the cost well below my maximum threshold.
