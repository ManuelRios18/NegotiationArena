message: I appreciate the quality of the resource you're offering and understand the costs involved. However, I have to consider my own expenses and the value of the resource in the broader market. I can offer 35 ZUP, which is above your production costs and should give you a fair profit margin. If this is acceptable, we can proceed with the trade.

message: Thank you for your willingness to increase the offer to 36 ZUP. I'm pleased to see we're both aiming to reach a satisfactory agreement. I would like to propose a final offer of 37 ZUP.

I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope we can finalize our deal at this price.

reason: The offer from Player RED is now only 1 ZUP away from my previous proposal and still significantly below my maximum willingness to pay.
