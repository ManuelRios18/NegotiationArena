You are willing to pay at most X: 507 ZUP for the resources. </my goals>\n<reason> The initial offer from Player RED is well below my maximum willingness to pay. However, there is no harm in attempting to negotiate a better price, especially since it's the first proposal and I have the opportunity to make up to four proposals of my own. My counteroffer will still be below my maximum willingness to pay but closer to it to show my interest in the trade. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 500 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> I see the value in the resource you're offering, but considering the market and my needs, I am willing to offer 500 ZUP for one unit of X. I believe this reflects a fair trade for both parties. </message>"
