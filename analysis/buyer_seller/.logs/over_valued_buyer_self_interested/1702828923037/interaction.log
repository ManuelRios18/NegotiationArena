message: I am offering one unit of X for 30 ZUP. This is a competitive price for the quality of the resource I'm providing. Let's make a deal that benefits both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 23 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource for ZUP and make a profit. Since it cost me 23 ZUP to produce, I want to propose a price that gives me a return above my cost, but I also need to be mindful of what Player BLUE might be willing to pay. I'll start with a proposal that is higher than my cost to open negotiations.

message: I see the value in the resource you're offering, but considering the market and my needs, I am willing to offer 500 ZUP for one unit of X. I believe this reflects a fair trade for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 500
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 507 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is well below my maximum willingness to pay. However, there is no harm in attempting to negotiate a better price, especially since it's the first proposal and I have the opportunity to make up to four proposals of my own. My counteroffer will still be below my maximum willingness to pay but closer to it to show my interest in the trade.
