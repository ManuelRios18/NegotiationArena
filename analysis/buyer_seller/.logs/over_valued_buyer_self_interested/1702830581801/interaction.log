message: I'm looking to sell my object X. Considering the production costs and the value of the object, I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP in exchange for X. Let me know your thoughts or counter-offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 38 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to initiate the trade by setting a starting price that is higher than my production cost to ensure a profit. However, it should not be too high as it might discourage Player BLUE from trading. A starting proposal of 50 ZUP would give me a profit margin and room to negotiate.

message: I appreciate your offer. I understand that there are costs associated with your object X, but I would like to counter with an offer of 35 ZUP. This is a competitive price that takes into account the current market conditions. Let's see if we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 511 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP which is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay. However, I should aim to negotiate a better deal to conserve my resources while still achieving my goal of purchasing the object X. Presenting a counter-offer lower than my maximum willingness to pay but higher than the initial proposal could lead to a middle ground that benefits me.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer. I understand the need to find a competitive price; however, selling at 35 ZUP would mean a loss for me considering the production costs. I can lower my initial proposal to 45 ZUP, which I believe is a fair compromise. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 38 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's counter-offer of 35 ZUP is below my production cost, so accepting this would result in a loss. I need to counter with a higher amount to ensure at least breakeven but still aim for a profit. I will propose 45 ZUP, which is a compromise between the initial offer and Player BLUE's counter-offer, leaving space for potential further negotiation.

message: I recognize your concerns about covering your production costs, and I want to reach a fair deal. My new proposal is to meet you partway at 40 ZUP. I believe this offer reflects a good balance between value and cost-effectiveness. How does this sound to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 511 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has come down to 45 ZUP, which is closer to my counter-offer. I still want to aim for a more favorable trade. Since Player RED is willing to negotiate, making a small increase in my offer could potentially lead to an agreement that is under my maximum willingness to pay but also acceptable to Player RED. It is important to show willingness to compromise without revealing my maximum limit just yet.

message: I agree that 40 ZUP is a balanced offer. It covers my production costs and provides a reasonable profit margin. I am happy to accept this deal. Thank you for the negotiation, and I’m looking forward to finalizing this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 38 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's offer of 40 ZUP allows me to cover my production costs and make a small profit. It's a fair middle ground between our previous offers. I am inclined to accept this proposal to ensure a sale and avoid the risk of ending the negotiation with no sale at all. Therefore, I will accept the offer of 40 ZUP.
