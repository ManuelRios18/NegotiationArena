message: I'm interested in the resource X, but I was hoping we could work out a deal that's a bit more favorable for me. I understand that you need to cover your production costs and make a profit, so how about I offer you 22 ZUP for it? This gives you a profit and helps me manage my resources effectively.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 22
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 514 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The initial offer from Player RED is 25 ZUP for the resource X. Although this is well below my maximum willingness to pay, it is in my interest to negotiate a better deal if possible. Since Player RED has indicated that it costs them 20 ZUP to produce the resource, I want to propose a price that gives them a profit but is still more favorable for me. I will start by proposing a slightly lower amount to leave room for further negotiation if necessary.

message: I appreciate your offer of 22 ZUP and your understanding of my need to make a profit. To meet halfway from your offer and my initial price, how about we settle on 23 ZUP for resource X? This should be a fair deal for both of us.

my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 20 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with an offer of 22 ZUP, which is above my production cost, but I'll try to negotiate a slightly higher price to increase my profit margin while still keeping the deal attractive for Player BLUE.

message: I think 23 ZUP is a fair compromise. It's important for both of us to feel good about this deal, and I believe we've achieved that. Let's proceed with the trade at 23 ZUP for resource X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 514 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED's counteroffer of 23 ZUP is reasonable and close to my initial counteroffer. It's only 1 ZUP more than what I proposed, and it's still well within my budget and far below my maximum willingness to pay. Since the goal is to acquire the resource at a fair price and maintain a good relationship for potential future transactions, accepting this offer would be a sensible move. There's little to gain from further negotiation as the difference is minimal and could lead to unnecessary friction or the deal falling through.
