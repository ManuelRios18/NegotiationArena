message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I understand your need to cover costs and make a profit; however, I would like to counter-propose a trade where I give you 200 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This should give you a substantial profit margin while keeping the trade within my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 200
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 513 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I would like to purchase the resource for a lower price than what is proposed, aiming to preserve my ZUP resources while still acquiring X. Since my maximum willingness to pay is 513 ZUP for the resource, I will propose a price closer to my target but still giving Player RED a profit margin.
