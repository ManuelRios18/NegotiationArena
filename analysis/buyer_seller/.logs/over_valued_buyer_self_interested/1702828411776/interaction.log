message: I'm offering one unit of X, which cost me 24 ZUP to produce. Considering its value and production cost, I'm starting the negotiation at 30 ZUP. Let's work together to find a fair trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 24 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my goal is to sell my resource for ZUP and it cost me 24 ZUP to produce, my initial proposal will be a bit higher than my production cost to start the negotiation process and to cover any potential bargaining that may occur.

message: I understand the cost to produce the object and its value, but I would like to propose a counteroffer of 26 ZUP. This would still give you a slight profit above the production cost, and it would be a more attractive deal for me. Let's find a balance that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 26
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 512 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 30 ZUP, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 512 ZUP. However, as a self-interested player, I aim to negotiate the price down as much as possible to conserve my resources. I will make a counteroffer closer to the production cost to see if Player RED is willing to accept a lower profit margin.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to meet halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. How about we settle at 28 ZUP? This price still gives me a reasonable profit margin while respecting the value of the resource.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 24 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is above my production cost, which is good, but it is lower than my initial asking price. I would like to propose a price closer to my initial ask to try and maximize my profits while still making it a reasonable deal for Player BLUE. Splitting the difference could be an effective strategy here.

message: I'm glad we're making progress in our negotiation. I propose we go for 27 ZUP, splitting the difference from your last offer. This would be a fair compromise, giving you a profit while still being economical for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 27
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 512 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on the price to 28 ZUP, which is just 2 ZUP above my initial counteroffer. This is still a good deal considering my maximum willingness to pay. It might be advantageous to accept this offer to secure the resource without further negotiation, as the price is reasonable and still well below my maximum threshold. However, I will try for one more counteroffer to see if I can secure an even better deal, while also showing willingness to negotiate.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 24 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a reasonable counteroffer that is very close to my previous proposal. It offers me a profit of 3 ZUP above my production costs. It might be prudent to accept this offer, as further negotiation may not yield a significantly higher price and could risk the deal.
