message: I appreciate your offer. The object you're selling does seem valuable, but I would like to propose a slightly lower price at 35 ZUP, considering the market and the potential for a long-term business relationship. Let's work together to make this deal beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 504 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 40 ZUP, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 504 ZUP. However, as a negotiating strategy, I want to propose a counteroffer that is lower to leave room for further negotiation and to aim for the best possible deal.

message: I understand your position and the importance of a long-term relationship. However, I need to cover my production costs and ideally make a small profit. How about we meet in the middle at 38 ZUP? This would cover my costs and give you the object for less than my initial asking price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 36 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE countered with a proposal of 35 ZUP, which is below my production cost. I need to negotiate a price that at least covers my costs. I'll counter with a price that gives me a marginal profit while still being close to their offer.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I believe we are close to a fair compromise. I propose 36 ZUP, which is a bit higher than my previous offer and still gives you a margin over the production costs. It's a reasonable step towards the middle ground we are both aiming for.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 504 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 38 ZUP from their initial offer of 40 ZUP. It's still below my maximum willingness to pay, but I think we can get a better deal. I'll make another counteroffer that's still above the 35 ZUP I initially offered but below the 38 ZUP they proposed, to continue the negotiation and work towards a price that's closer to my target while still being fair to both parties.
