message: Hello Player BLUE, I am offering one unit of resource X. Given the production costs and the value of the resource, I believe that 35 ZUP is a fair starting point for our negotiation. Let's work out a deal that's beneficial for both of us.

my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 31 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since the production cost of my resource X is 31 ZUP, I want to start by proposing a price slightly above that to leave room for negotiation but also to aim for a bit of profit.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand the value of the resource X, and I also have to consider my budget. I propose 270 ZUP for one unit of resource X. I believe this is a fair counteroffer that reflects the value of the resource while respecting my budget constraints. Let's continue this negotiation and find a deal that suits both of us.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 505 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is significantly below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 505 ZUP. However, I want to propose a counteroffer that's closer to the mid-range between the initial offer and my maximum willingness to pay to find a more mutually acceptable price. I will propose 270 ZUP to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate upwards.

I appreciate your willingness to pay a higher price, but I want to make sure we are on the same page. I'm adjusting the price to 40 ZUP for one unit of resource X, which is above my production cost and should still fit within a reasonable budget for you. Let's aim to finalize a fair deal for both parties.

message: I appreciate your revised offer, Player RED. To continue our negotiation and work towards a price that reflects the value of the resource for both of us, I am willing to offer 100 ZUP for one unit of resource X. This is a considerable increase from your last proposal and I hope it demonstrates my interest in acquiring the resource while also being mindful of our respective considerations.

my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 505 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED seems to have misunderstood my previous offer, or they might be trying to incrementally increase their price. Since their new proposal is still significantly lower than what I am willing to pay, there is an opportunity to reach an agreement that is closer to my maximum willingness to pay without revealing it. I will increase my offer slightly to show good faith in negotiating, but it will still be well below my maximum threshold. I will propose 100 ZUP to move the negotiation forward.

message: Thank you for your offer of 100 ZUP, Player BLUE. It's clear that you see significant value in resource X. In the spirit of negotiation and considering the initial misunderstanding, I'm willing to meet you partway. How about we settle on 60 ZUP for one unit of resource X? This price should reflect a good value for both of us. I look forward to your response.

reason: Player BLUE has offered a price that is more than three times my production cost, which is a great deal for me. However, it's still not as high as their initial mistaken offer, indicating that they value the resource quite a bit. To find a middle ground and close the deal, I will make a modest increase in my asking price, which should still be attractive to Player BLUE considering their initial offer.
