message: I'm interested in your resource, and I appreciate you reaching out with an offer. That said, I'd like to counter with an offer of 20 ZUP. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 515 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 25 ZUP for their resource. Since I am willing to pay up to 515 ZUP for the resource, this is a favorable deal. However, it's often beneficial to negotiate to see if I can acquire the resource for an even lower price. I will make a counteroffer that is lower than the asking price but still reasonable, to maintain good faith in negotiations.

message: Thank you for your offer. I understand we're both looking for a fair deal. How about we meet in the middle? I propose 22 ZUP for my resource. This gives me a slight profit and ensures you're getting the resource for less than my initial asking price.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 20 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has matched my production cost, but I aim to make a profit. I will propose a price that splits the difference between my initial offer and their counteroffer. This should be more appealing to Player BLUE while still allowing me to make a profit.

message: I think meeting in the middle is fair. I accept your offer of 22 ZUP for the resource. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 515 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable counteroffer of 22 ZUP, which is still well below my maximum willingness to pay. It is a good deal, and by accepting it, I would still save considerably compared to my initial cap. This leaves room for future transactions or unexpected expenses. Since the deal is within my favorable range, it is in my best interest to accept this offer.
