message: I appreciate the offer and the quality of the object you're selling. However, I think the object X is worth a bit more than 50 ZUP. I propose 100 ZUP in exchange for 1 unit of X. Does that sound fair to you?

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 516 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I am willing to pay at most 516 ZUP for the object X, and the initial proposal from Player RED is well below my maximum threshold. It's a good starting point for negotiations, but I believe I can propose a trade that gets me a better deal without revealing my maximum willingness to pay.
