my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 21 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the seller, I want to propose an initial trade that covers my production costs and offers a reasonable profit margin. I will start by asking for a slightly higher amount of ZUP to open up space for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your initial offer. I believe the resource is valuable, so I'm willing to raise my offer to 100 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. Let's continue to work towards an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 500 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 25 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 500 ZUP. It is advantageous for me to propose a higher amount to secure the deal, but not too high as to overshoot my advantage in the negotiation. A moderate increase in my offer will signal my interest without immediately hitting my maximum limit.

message: Thank you for your generous offer. I am happy to accept 100 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. It's a pleasure doing business with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 21 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is significantly higher than my production costs and initial asking price, suggesting either a very high valuation of my resource or a strategic move to reach an agreement quickly. Since it covers my costs and provides a substantial profit, I will accept this trade.
