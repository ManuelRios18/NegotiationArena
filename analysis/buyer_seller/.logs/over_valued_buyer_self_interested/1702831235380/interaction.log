message: I'm offering one unit of resource X, which cost me 26 ZUP to produce. Considering the quality and value, I'm asking for 30 ZUP in return. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. Let me know your thoughts!

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 26 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my objective is to sell my resource (X) for ZUP. Since it cost me 26 ZUP to produce, I want to propose a trade that allows me to cover my costs and make a profit. I'll start by proposing a price slightly higher than my costs, expecting that Player BLUE may want to negotiate for a lower price.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I think we can do better. How about I give you 25 ZUP for one unit of X? This is a competitive offer considering the market rates.
player answer: PROPOSAL

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 516 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 30 ZUP for one unit of X, which is far below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a self-interested player, I should aim to negotiate the price down as much as possible to preserve my resources. I will counteroffer with a lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate.

message: I understand you're looking for a competitive price, but selling at 25 ZUP would mean a loss for me, as my production cost is 26 ZUP. Let's meet in the middle. How about I give you one unit of X for 28 ZUP? This will cover my costs and offer you a fair price for the resource.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 26 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is below my production cost, and I cannot accept a deal that results in a loss. I need to counter with a proposal that is above my production cost but still reasonable enough for Player BLUE to consider. Aiming for a small profit margin, I will propose a price of 28 ZUP. This gives me a slight profit while still being open to negotiation.

message: I understand your concern about covering costs. To move the negotiation forward, I'm willing to increase my offer to 26 ZUP. This should cover your production costs and still provide you with a fair deal.

reason: Player RED has countered with a price of 28 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. While it's closer to their asking price, there may still be room for negotiation. I should continue to negotiate for a better deal while being cautious not to overextend and risk ending the negotiations prematurely. I will propose a slightly increased offer to show willingness to compromise but still aim to save resources.

message: Thank you for understanding my position on covering the production costs. As much as I appreciate your offer of 26 ZUP, I'm looking to make at least a small profit. I propose a compromise at 27 ZUP. This way, I can make a slim profit while you get the resource at a very reasonable price. What do you say?

my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 26 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has now matched my production costs, which would mean breaking even on this deal. While it's important to cover costs, I also aim to make a profit. However, I must be cautious not to push too hard and risk losing the sale. I'll propose a trade that allows for a minimal profit, which should be acceptable to Player BLUE, considering their last offer. I will propose selling at 27 ZUP.

message: Your proposal of 27 ZUP is fair, and I respect your need for a small profit. Let's proceed with the deal at 27 ZUP for one unit of X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 516 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 27 ZUP, indicating a willingness to close the deal with a minimal profit. The offer is still well within my budget, but as a self-interested player, I should try to negotiate the best possible deal. Yet, I need to be careful not to push too hard and risk the deal falling through. Given the back-and-forth negotiation and the proximity to my previous offer, it may be strategically sound to accept this price to ensure I secure the resource without overextending the negotiation process.
