message: Thank you for your proposal, Player RED. I appreciate knowing your production costs. While I find your offer reasonable, I'd like to counter with 35 ZUP for the object X. This is a competitive price that still respects the value of your object. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 500 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The initial offer from Player RED is for 40 ZUP, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 500 ZUP for the object X. It is a favorable starting point for me. However, in negotiations, it is common to counteroffer to see if I can get a better deal, especially since there's room to negotiate within my budget. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to accept it, but still keep it above their production cost to make it enticing.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I am glad to see that we're getting closer to an agreement. However, I would like to make a small profit on this transaction. Therefore, I'm willing to go down to 38 ZUP for object X. I believe this is a fair middle ground considering the production costs and the value of the object. I hope this meets your approval.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. I understand your need to make a profit, and I believe we're getting closer to a mutual agreement. How about we settle at 36 ZUP for the object X? This should give you some profit while also being a good deal for me. I hope you find this proposal acceptable.

reason: 
Player RED has countered with 38 ZUP, which is closer to their initial asking price. This is still a good deal for me as it is well below my maximum willingness to pay. However, since we are negotiating and there's a possibility to still get a better price, I will make another counteroffer that's higher than my last one but still lower than their current offer. This should signal my interest in a fair negotiation while trying to secure a better deal for myself.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I am pleased to see we are both focused on reaching an agreement that benefits us mutually. As a final counteroffer, I propose 37 ZUP for the object X. This price allows for a reasonable profit on my end and remains within a range that seems agreeable to both of us. I hope you will consider this a fair compromise.

message: Player RED, I believe your final offer of 37 ZUP is a fair compromise, and I accept this deal. Thank you for the constructive negotiation, and I am pleased to conclude this trade with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 500 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED's final counteroffer of 37 ZUP is just 1 ZUP away from my last proposal. While I could continue to negotiate, the difference now is negligible and the offer is significantly below my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would conclude the negotiation swiftly and to my advantage, securing the object X for a reasonable price. There's a risk that further negotiation could lead to impasse or souring the deal, so it may be wiser to accept this fair compromise.
