message: I have an object X for sale, which cost me 24 ZUP to produce. I propose to trade it for 30 ZUP to cover my costs and to allow for a fair profit margin. I believe this is a reasonable starting point for our negotiation. Are you interested in this offer?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 24 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My goal is to sell the resource for at least the cost of production, which is 24 ZUP. I will propose a trade slightly above the production cost to leave room for negotiation and to potentially make a profit.

message: I appreciate your offer and understand your need for profit. However, I would like to propose a trade of 26 ZUP for the object X. This still gives you a bit over your production cost, ensuring you make a profit while also being a more favorable deal for me. Let's find a fair middle ground.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 512 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price from Player RED is 30 ZUP, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 512 ZUP. However, as a self-interested player, I should aim to negotiate the price down closer to their production cost to preserve my resources while still obtaining the object X. I will propose a lower amount that is still above their cost of production, which may be acceptable to them and beneficial to me.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 26 ZUP. I'm glad to see we're approaching a fair agreement. To meet in the middle, I propose 28 ZUP. This is slightly above your offer but still below my initial ask, which I believe is a fair compromise for both of us. How does that sound to you?

reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is above my production cost, which meets my minimum goal. However, since it's a negotiation, I will counter with a slightly higher amount to aim for a higher profit, yet still closer to Player BLUE's offer to show willingness to negotiate.

message: I'm glad to see we're both working towards a fair deal. Your offer of 28 ZUP is reasonable, but I'd like to propose 27 ZUP. It's a small adjustment from your proposal but would make the deal more balanced from my perspective. I believe this is a small but meaningful concession that could lead us to a quick agreement.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 27
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 512 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 28 ZUP from their initial 30 ZUP. This is closer to my counteroffer but still above what I initially proposed. Since I am still far from my maximum willingness to pay, I could either accept this offer or try to negotiate further down for a better deal, considering I have more proposals I can make. I will attempt one more counteroffer to get a slightly better price.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground. I accept your offer of 27 ZUP for the object X. It's a fair deal for both of us. Let's proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 24 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a reasonable counteroffer of 27 ZUP, which is a compromise between their last offer and my last proposal. It's only 1 ZUP less than what I asked for, and it still provides me with a profit. Accepting this offer would conclude the negotiation favorably for both parties without further back and forth, saving time and potentially securing the deal.
