message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. I understand that you want to cover your costs and make a profit. I am interested in the object, and I would like to make a counteroffer which I believe is closer to a fair middle ground for both of us. I propose giving you 268 ZUP for 1 unit of object X. Looking forward to your response.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 501 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay, which is 501 ZUP for the object. However, to ensure a good deal, I should attempt to negotiate for a price that is lower than my maximum willingness to pay but higher than the initial offer of 35 ZUP to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I will propose a counteroffer that is closer to the median of the initial offer and my maximum willingness to pay.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand the need for negotiation, and I appreciate your willingness to engage. I have considered your proposal, and I'd like to suggest a price that I feel better reflects the value of the object. How about I give you 1 unit of object X for 32 ZUP? This price is a bit closer to my original cost and allows for a fair transaction for both of us. Let's continue this conversation and reach a mutual agreement.

message: I appreciate your willingness to lower the price even further, Player RED. I believe that we both are aiming for a fair trade. Considering your latest offer, I would like to propose a new price of 150 ZUP for 1 unit of object X. This offer is more than four times your last proposal and should cover your costs while also giving you a reasonable profit margin. Let's work towards finalizing this deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 150
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 501 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made an unusual move by proposing a lower price than their initial offer. This could indicate a strong desire to sell or a misunderstanding. Since my last offer was well above their starting point, I need to reassess and propose a new trade that is above their latest offer, but still provides a good deal for me, without reaching my maximum willingness to pay.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I am glad to see we are converging on a price that seems fair to both of us. I propose a slight increase to 160 ZUP for 1 unit of object X. This price fully covers my production costs and offers me a profit margin that I believe is just and reasonable for the value that object X provides. I hope this meets your valuation of the object as well, and I look forward to your response so we can finalize this deal.

message: Player RED, your proposal of 160 ZUP for 1 unit of object X is acceptable to me. I agree that it covers your production costs and provides a fair profit margin. I am ready to finalize the deal at this price. Thank you for the constructive negotiation, and I look forward to future transactions.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 501 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's latest offer of 160 ZUP for 1 unit of object X is still well below my maximum willingness to pay. The negotiation has been progressive, with both parties making concessions. Since the offer is reasonable and only slightly above my previous proposal, it would be a good strategic choice to accept this offer to ensure a successful transaction without further back-and-forth, provided that the deal is still profitable for me.
