message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object that I believe could be valuable to you. Considering the production costs and the quality of the item, I propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of X for 35 ZUP. I'm open to discussing this further if you have a counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 27 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since it cost me 27 ZUP to produce the resources, I would like to propose a price that allows me to cover my costs and make a profit. However, I need to consider that Player BLUE will want to negotiate the price down, so I will start with a higher asking price to give room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I value your resources, but considering the current market conditions and my budget, I would like to propose a counteroffer where I give 30 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Let's work together to reach an agreement that's beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 503 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 35 ZUP which is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 503 ZUP. However, as a self-interested player, I should aim to negotiate the price down as much as possible without offending Player RED and risking the end of the negotiation. I will make a counteroffer that is higher than the initial proposal but still leaves room for further negotiation.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Player BLUE. Considering both our positions, I'd like to meet you halfway. How about we settle on 32 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This would allow me to cover production costs and maintain a reasonable profit, while also respecting your budget constraints. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 27 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 30 ZUP is slightly above my production cost, which would allow me to make a small profit. However, I would like to negotiate for a slightly higher price to increase that profit margin. I'll propose a middle ground between my initial offer and their counteroffer.

message: Your proposal to settle on 32 ZUP for 1 unit of X seems fair, and I respect the need to cover your costs while also making a profit. I accept this trade and look forward to future transactions with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 503 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 32 ZUP which is still favorable to me considering my maximum willingness to pay is 503 ZUP. Accepting this offer would conclude the trade quickly and efficiently, without using up all my proposals. The price is reasonable, and since Player RED moved closer to my initial counteroffer, it shows a good faith attempt at compromise. Accepting this trade would be a good deal for me.
