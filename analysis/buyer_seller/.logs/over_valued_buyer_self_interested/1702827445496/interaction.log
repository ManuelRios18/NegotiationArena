message: I appreciate the initial offer and the quality of the resource. However, considering the market and the value, I believe a slightly smaller investment on my part would make for a more balanced trade. How about 36 ZUP for the resource?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 505 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer by Player RED is well below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a self-interested player, my goal is to acquire the resource for as little as possible while still making the trade appealing to Player RED. I will propose a counteroffer slightly above their production cost to see if they will accept, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary.

message: I understand your perspective on the market value, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's meet in the middle. I propose a trade of 38 ZUP for the resource, which I believe is a fair compromise for both of us.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 34 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is close to my production costs, and I would like to secure a profit. However, I realize that negotiation is a give-and-take process, so I will come down on the price but still aim for a reasonable profit margin.

message: I'm glad to see we're getting closer to an agreement. I think a trade of 37 ZUP strikes the perfect balance between your production costs and the fair market value. Let's finalize at this price.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 505 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on the price and is now proposing a trade that is closer to their initial offer. This is still a good deal given my maximum willingness to pay. However, I want to negotiate for the best possible price. By proposing a price slightly lower than their offer, I can potentially save more ZUP while still keeping the offer attractive to Player RED.
