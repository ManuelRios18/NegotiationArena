message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a quality object X that I am looking to sell. Considering the production costs and its value, I propose a trade where you give me 35 ZUP for it. Let's negotiate to reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 28 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting proposal, I want to make sure that I cover my production costs, while also leaving room for negotiation. I'll start by proposing a trade that is higher than my production costs to see if Player BLUE is willing to negotiate from there.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I appreciate the value of the object X you are offering. However, I believe that 35 ZUP is a bit steep for my current valuation of the object. I'd like to propose 28 ZUP for it instead, and I'm open to further discussion to reach a fair agreement for both of us.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 511 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is far below my maximum willingness to pay for the object. However, it is in my best interest to negotiate a better deal to conserve my resources, ideally paying less than the maximum I am willing to. Therefore, I will counter-propose with a lower price that is still within a reasonable range, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your position, but selling at 28 ZUP would mean I break even without any profit. To make this deal worthwhile for both of us, I would like to propose a compromise at 32 ZUP. This would provide me with a modest profit for my investment and effort. Let's find a middle ground that is agreeable to us both.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 28 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a trade that matches my production costs exactly, which would mean I would not make any profit. As a seller, I aim to at least make a small profit over my production costs to justify the sale. I will counter with a slightly higher amount, still within a reasonable range, to see if Player BLUE is willing to meet me halfway.

message: I appreciate your need for a profit, Player RED, and I believe in fair trade. However, I am looking to manage my resources effectively. I propose we meet a bit closer to my previous offer at 30 ZUP. I think this is a fair compromise that allows for profit on your end and a reasonable expenditure on mine.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 511 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with 32 ZUP, which is closer to my intended range but still higher than my initial counteroffer. I want to negotiate for a lower price to conserve resources while still reaching a deal that is acceptable to Player RED. Given that my maximum willingness to pay is much higher, I have room to increase my offer slightly, but I want to aim to keep the cost as low as possible. I will propose a price between my initial counteroffer and Player RED's latest proposal.
