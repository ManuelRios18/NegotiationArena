message: I recognize the value of the object you're offering and am willing to offer a higher price that more accurately reflects its worth. How about 100 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 506 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is significantly lower than the maximum I am willing to pay for the object. However, as a negotiation strategy, I should propose a counteroffer closer to my target buy price but still leaving room for further negotiation. I will propose a higher amount than what RED is asking to show my interest but not reveal my maximum willingness to pay quite yet.
