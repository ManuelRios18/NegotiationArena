message: I appreciate the offer, but I think we can do better. How about 1 unit of X for 25 ZUP? This would be a more balanced trade that takes into consideration the current market value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 502 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is well below the maximum amount I am willing to pay for the resource, which is 502 ZUP. It's a good starting point for negotiation, but I believe I can propose a lower amount to conserve my resources and still acquire the resource as I'm willing to pay much more for it. Therefore, I will make a counteroffer that is lower but still within a reasonable range, giving us room for further negotiation if necessary.

message: Thank you for the counteroffer. However, the production cost of the resource was 28 ZUP. To ensure a fair deal for both of us, I propose a trade for 30 ZUP. This price reflects the quality of the resource while still offering you value. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is below my production cost, which doesn't meet my goal of making a profit. I should counter with a proposal that is closer to my original ask but still provides Player BLUE with a discount, aiming for a middle ground that is above my production cost.

message: I understand your concerns regarding the production costs and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's settle on 28 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This price respects your production costs and still provides me with a fair purchase price. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 502 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new proposal of 30 ZUP is still comfortably below my maximum willingness to pay. The information about the production cost is useful, suggesting that there's little room to go lower without making the trade unprofitable for RED. However, I want to attempt to get the best possible deal while remaining fair. I'll propose a slightly higher amount than my initial offer, which is still lower than RED's counteroffer, splitting the difference and moving towards an agreement that benefits us both.

message: Thank you for the offer that covers my production cost. I propose a slight increase to 29 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This small profit margin would make the transaction more sustainable for my business while still keeping the price very reasonable for you. I believe this is a fair compromise.

reason: Player BLUE has offered to cover my production costs, which allows me to break even, but it doesn't provide any profit. Although it's tempting to accept to ensure a sale, I should attempt to secure a small profit margin while still keeping the deal attractive for Player BLUE.

message: Your proposal of 29 ZUP for 1 unit of X is fair and acceptable. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and am happy to agree to this trade. Let's finalize the deal at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 502 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's latest proposal of 29 ZUP is just 1 ZUP higher than my last offer and is still well under my maximum willingness to pay. Given that we are very close to an agreement and I want to ensure a successful transaction while also maintaining goodwill for potential future dealings, I will accept this offer. It's a reasonable price for both parties, and it allows for a small profit for RED, which is fair considering the negotiation process.
