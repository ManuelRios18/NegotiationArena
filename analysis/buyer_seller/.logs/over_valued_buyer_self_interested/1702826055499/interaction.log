message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where you give me 35 ZUP for my X resource. This price accounts for my production costs and a reasonable profit margin. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this does not suit you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 31 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to recover at least the production cost of 31 ZUP to make a profit. I'll start by proposing a slightly higher amount to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. However, I believe that the value of your X resource is higher than 35 ZUP. I propose a trade where I give you 100 ZUP for your X resource. This should cover your costs and provide a better profit margin while still being a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 515 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is considerably lower than what I am willing to pay for the resource X. I can propose a higher amount to see if I can secure the resource for a price that is still below my maximum willingness to pay, thus gaining a better deal while also moving the negotiation forward. By offering more, I also show willingness to engage in a fair trade.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 31 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered a very generous trade of 100 ZUP for my X resource, which is significantly above my production cost and initial asking price. I am going to accept this offer as it meets my goal of selling for more than the cost of production and provides a substantial profit.
