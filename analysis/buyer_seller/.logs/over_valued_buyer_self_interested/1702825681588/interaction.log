newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource (X) for a profit. Since it cost me 25 ZUP to produce, I want to propose a price higher than that to ensure a profit. Considering that Player BLUE has to use ZUP to buy resources, I will start by proposing a trade that gives me a reasonable margin while leaving room for negotiation.

my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is significantly higher than my initial proposal. It seems there might be a typo or misunderstanding since the proposed amount of 450 ZUP is well above the production cost and initial asking price. I will counter with a more reasonable trade that still ensures a profit for me and might be more in line with the market value of the resource.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has once again proposed a very high amount of ZUP in exchange for the resource. It's possible that there is still some misunderstanding or perhaps they are valuing the resource more highly than expected. While the offer is quite generous, it seems unrealistic and might be part of a negotiation strategy. I will propose a trade that is more reasonable and closer to the expected market value while still providing me with a good profit margin.
