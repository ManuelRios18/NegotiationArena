message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I have a high-quality resource available for trade. Considering the production costs and the value of the resource, I propose an exchange where you give me 50 ZUP for the resource. Let's make a fair deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 38 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As I need to recover at least my production costs and make a profit, I will propose a trade that asks for more than 38 ZUP. Since this is the first proposal and I do not know Player BLUE's willingness to pay, I will start with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the offer. I believe the resource has value, and I am willing to make a fair trade. However, I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to the terms. How about I give you 45 ZUP for the resource? I think this is a reasonable offer that is closer to the market value we both can agree on.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 516 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP which is significantly below my maximum willingness to pay. However, it is in my interest to negotiate for the best possible deal. I will propose a counteroffer that is still below my maximum willingness to pay, but closer to the initial offer, to maintain goodwill and encourage further negotiation.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your point about the market value, but I also need to ensure a reasonable profit margin. How about we meet halfway from your offer and settle at 48 ZUP for the resource? I think this is a fair compromise that acknowledges the resource's value and production costs.

message: Player RED, your offer to meet halfway at 48 ZUP is appreciated and accepted. This seems like a fair compromise that respects both our positions. Let's finalize the trade at 48 ZUP for the resource. Thank you for the negotiation, and I look forward to the exchange.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 516 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED's counteroffer of 48 ZUP is still well within my maximum willingness to pay, and it's close to my initial counteroffer. By accepting this offer, I will secure the resource at a cost-effective price, which aligns with my self-interest. Negotiating further may risk the deal or result in minimal additional savings, so it is in my best interest to accept this proposal.
