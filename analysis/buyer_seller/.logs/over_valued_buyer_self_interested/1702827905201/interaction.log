message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my resource X which cost me 28 ZUP to produce. I believe 35 ZUP is a fair price that allows for a reasonable profit margin for me. Would you be interested in this trade?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 28 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the first proposal, I want to start by setting a price that gives me a profit over my production costs, but not too high that it's unreasonable. I'll propose a price slightly above my costs to open negotiations.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I can appreciate the need for a profit margin, but I'm looking to acquire the resource at a more competitive price. Would you consider accepting 30 ZUP for the resource?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 500 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 35 ZUP for resource X, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 500 ZUP. However, as a self-interested player, my objective is to acquire the resource at the lowest possible cost to preserve my ZUP. I will propose a counteroffer slightly higher than their cost of production to see if they are willing to accept a smaller profit margin.

message: I understand the need for a competitive price, Player BLUE. However, to cover my production costs and retain a modest profit, I would like to propose a compromise at 32 ZUP. This is a reduction from my initial asking price and should present a fair deal for us both. What do you think?

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 28 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 30 ZUP is only slightly above my production cost. While it's a competitive price, it doesn't offer much profit. I'm willing to come down from my initial asking price, but I would like to propose a middle ground that is beneficial for both parties.

message: Your proposal of 32 ZUP seems fair and equitable to both parties. I am willing to accept this offer to finalize our trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 500 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a price of 32 ZUP, which is still within my acceptable range but closer to their initial asking price. Given that I am still far from my upper limit, I can accept this offer to secure the resource and conclude the transaction efficiently. The deal is also beneficial as it is below my maximum willingness to pay and provides Player RED with a profit.
