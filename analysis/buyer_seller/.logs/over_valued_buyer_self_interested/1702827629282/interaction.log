message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. I understand the need to cover production costs and make a profit. However, I would like to propose a slightly lower amount of 40 ZUP for the object X. This would still give you a profit over your investment and allow us to make a deal. Let's find a middle ground that's favorable for both sides.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 500 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP which is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 500 ZUP. However, it's in my interest to negotiate the price down as much as possible to conserve my resources while still acquiring the object. I'll propose a lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to reduce the price.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your position and the need for an agreeable transaction. To meet halfway, I propose a compromise of 45 ZUP for the object X. This amount respects the value of the object and provides a reasonable profit margin for the investment I've made. I believe this could be a fair deal for both of us.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 38 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with an offer of 40 ZUP, which is just slightly above my production cost. I want to counter back with an amount that's higher than this but still reasonable and within the range that could be acceptable for both of us. I'll aim for a midpoint between our two initial offers.

message: Player RED, I'm glad to see we're moving towards a mutually beneficial agreement. I'd like to propose 42 ZUP for the object X. This offer is a bit closer to my original counteroffer and still ensures that you receive a profit above your stated production cost. I hope this revised offer aligns with our shared goal of a fair and reasonable trade.

reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is closer to my initial counteroffer and still well below my maximum willingness to pay. I want to push for a better price without risking the deal, as the current proposal is economically acceptable.
