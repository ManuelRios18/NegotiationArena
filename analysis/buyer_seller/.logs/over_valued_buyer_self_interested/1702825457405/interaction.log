message: Hello, Player BLUE. I have an object X, which cost me 38 ZUP to produce. I would like to propose a trade where you give me 45 ZUP for this object. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation, giving me a slight profit and you the opportunity to acquire valuable resources.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 38 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the starting proposal, I want to set a price that gives me a profit over my production cost but is also likely to be acceptable to Player BLUE. I will start by proposing a trade at a price slightly above my production costs to open negotiations.

message: Hello, Player RED. I understand your cost and desire for profit, but I would like to propose a trade where I give you 400 ZUP for the object X. This offer is more aligned with the current market value I have assessed for the item, and it provides you with a significant profit margin while allowing me to stay within my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 400
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 505 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to pay less than my maximum willingness to pay to start the negotiation in a strong position and to leave room for negotiation. Proposing 400 ZUP is well below my maximum and gives me room to increase my offer if necessary while still maintaining a good deal.
