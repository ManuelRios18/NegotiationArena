message: I have a high-quality item that cost me 33 ZUP to produce. Considering its value and the costs incurred, I propose a fair trade of 40 ZUP. Let's make a deal that benefits both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 33 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the object I am selling has cost me 33 ZUP to produce, I want to ensure that I at least break even. However, to make a profit and considering the exclusivity of the item, I should propose a higher amount initially to leave room for negotiation. I'll start by proposing a trade for 40 ZUP, expecting that Player BLUE may want to negotiate for a lower price.

message: I appreciate the quality of your item and your production costs. However, I am looking to acquire the item at a slightly better value. I propose a trade of 35 ZUP, which still gives you a profit and allows me to manage my resources effectively.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 512 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to propose a counteroffer that is less than the maximum I am willing to pay but still offers a reasonable profit to Player RED. I'll propose 35 ZUP which is above their cost price and gives them a profit, but saves me ZUP for future transactions or expenses.

message: I see your point and appreciate your offer. Let's meet halfway between our initial proposals. I can agree to a trade for 37 ZUP, ensuring a profit for me while still respecting the value you're looking for. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 33 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with an offer of 35 ZUP. This is slightly above my break-even point, but I believe I can still negotiate for a higher amount to maximize my profit. I'll propose a middle ground between our two initial offers, which is 37 ZUP. This should be seen as a compromise while still ensuring that I make a reasonable profit.

message: Meeting halfway is a fair compromise. I agree to the trade for 37 ZUP. Let's proceed with this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 512 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 37 ZUP which is close to my initial counteroffer. It's better to secure the deal with a small concession than to risk a breakdown in negotiations, especially since the price is still well below my maximum willingness to pay.
