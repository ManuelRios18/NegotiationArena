message: Thank you for the opening offer. I believe the resource X has more value, so I would like to propose 300 ZUP for 1 unit of X. I think this is a more reflective of its market value. Let's continue the negotiation.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 500 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is far below what I'm willing to pay; however, it's in my interest to negotiate a higher price that is closer to my maximum willingness to pay without revealing that amount right away. I will propose a counteroffer that is significantly higher but still leaves room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your high valuation of the resource X. However, I want to make sure we engage in a fair trade. How about we settle at 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This is still above my initial cost and gives us both a good deal. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 22 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counter-offer is significantly above my initial asking price, which is a good sign. It suggests they value the resource highly. However, the increase to 300 ZUP seems like a steep jump. While it's beneficial to sell at a higher price, I want to propose a more balanced counter-offer to continue the negotiation in good faith and avoid the appearance of taking undue advantage of their high valuation.
