my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 500 ZUP for the resources.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I understand market conditions may affect valuation, but I must cover my production costs of 26 ZUP. I propose a trade for 28 ZUP, which I believe is a fair middle ground. Let me know if this works for you or if you have another proposal in mind.
