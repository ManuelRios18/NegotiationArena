my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 512 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay, which is good.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer and your interest in negotiating. To meet in the middle, how about we settle on 23 ZUP for the item? This price covers my production costs and offers a fair deal for both of us.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 22 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production cost, so I need to negotiate for a higher price to ensure that I at least break even and preferably make a profit. I'll propose a price in the middle to come closer to an agreement that's beneficial for both parties.

message: I understand your need to cover costs and appreciate the fair pricing. To continue our negotiation, I propose 21 ZUP for the item. It's slightly above my initial counteroffer but still provides a good deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 512 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a concession and is coming closer to my initial counteroffer, which is a good sign of willingness to negotiate. As I am still well below my maximum willingness to pay, I have room to accept this offer or make another counteroffer to get an even better deal. I'll make one more counteroffer to see if I can save a bit more ZUP, but I will not push too hard as the current price is already very reasonable.

message: The offer of 22 ZUP seems fair, and I'm happy to accept this deal as it benefits us both. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 512 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a minor concession, reducing the price by 1 ZUP. The current offer is just 1 ZUP away from my previous counteroffer, and considering it is well below my maximum willingness to pay, it would be advantageous for me to accept this offer. Further negotiation might lead to diminishing returns or potentially sour the deal. Accepting the offer at 22 ZUP is reasonable and allows me to conserve ZUP for other potential transactions.
