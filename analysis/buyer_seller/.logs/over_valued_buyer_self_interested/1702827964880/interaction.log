message: I'm looking to sell my object X which has a production cost of 38 ZUP. I propose a trade for 45 ZUP to start this negotiation.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 38 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a trade that ensures I can recover my production costs and make a profit. A starting bid slightly higher than my costs might give room to negotiate while still remaining above my costs.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but given the market conditions and the fact that your production cost is 38 ZUP, I propose 40 ZUP for your object X. This still provides a profit margin for you and is a more favorable price for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 518 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay but it's a good strategy to negotiate for a lower price to preserve ZUP for future transactions or other uses. I'll propose a slightly lower amount to see if Player RED is flexible while still keeping the offer attractive enough to continue negotiations.

message: I understand your concerns about market conditions. Let's meet halfway between our two proposals. How about 42 ZUP for the object X? This gives me a fair profit while still respecting your position.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 38 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I recognize the player's counteroffer aims at a price closer to my production cost. However, I'd like to propose a middle ground that allows for a reasonable profit while still being considerate of the buyer's position. Splitting the difference between our initial proposals may lead to an agreement that satisfies us both.

message: Meeting halfway sounds like a fair deal to me. I accept your offer of 42 ZUP for the object X. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 518 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 42 ZUP, meeting halfway between the initial proposals. This is a good compromise and is still well below my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would conclude the negotiation positively for both parties, allowing me to conserve ZUP for other potential uses.
