message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I understand the value of the product, but I would like to propose a counteroffer where I give you 100 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This should give you a reasonable profit margin while keeping the deal within my budget. I believe this is a step towards a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 508 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer is well below my maximum willingness to pay. However, it is in my interest to negotiate a price that is closer to the seller's cost to maximize my benefit. I will propose a price that is higher than their cost to produce but still well below my maximum willingness to pay. This should be attractive to the seller while preserving my resources.
