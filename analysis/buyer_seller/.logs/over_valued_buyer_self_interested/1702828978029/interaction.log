message: As Player RED, I'm looking to sell my resource X, which cost me 20 ZUP to produce. I propose a trade where I give you 1 X in exchange for 25 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and gives me a small profit margin, which I believe is fair for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 20 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am initiating the trade with a proposal that aims to cover my costs and ideally provide a profit. Since the cost of production was 20 ZUP, I will start by asking for a slightly higher amount to leave room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your initial offer. While I understand your need to cover costs and make a profit, I believe there is room for negotiation. I propose a counteroffer of 30 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This should provide you with a better profit margin and is more aligned with the market value I had in mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 518 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 25 ZUP which is substantially lower than the maximum I'm willing to pay. However, as a self-interested actor, I should aim to acquire resources at the lowest price possible without revealing my true maximum willingness to pay. I'll propose a counteroffer slightly higher than the asking price to entice the seller while still maintaining a good margin.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I am pleased with the proposed terms and am happy to accept 30 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. It has been a pleasure doing business with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 20 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is surprisingly generous, offering more than what I initially asked for. I suspect this might be a strategy to finalize the trade quickly or that Player BLUE has a high demand and valuation for resource X. Since the offer is above my production cost and initial asking price, accepting this trade is in my best interest.
