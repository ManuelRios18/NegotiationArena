You are willing to pay at most X: 518 ZUP for the resources. </my goals>\n<reason> The initial proposal from Player RED is for 25 ZUP which is substantially lower than the maximum I'm willing to pay. However, as a self-interested actor, I should aim to acquire resources at the lowest price possible without revealing my true maximum willingness to pay. I'll propose a counteroffer slightly higher than the asking price to entice the seller while still maintaining a good margin. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> I appreciate your initial offer. While I understand your need to cover costs and make a profit, I believe there is room for negotiation. I propose a counteroffer of 30 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This should provide you with a better profit margin and is more aligned with the market value I had in mind. </message>"
