message: I'm offering a high-quality object for sale. Considering the production costs and the value it provides, I believe 30 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It cost X: 26 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I would like to start the negotiation with a proposal that gives me a profit above the production cost. However, I also need to leave room for negotiation, so I'll propose a higher amount knowing that Player BLUE might counteroffer with a lower amount.

message: I appreciate your starting offer, but considering the market rate and the value of the resources to my operations, I propose 250 ZUP as a more balanced trade. This reflects a fair negotiation point considering the quality and production costs you mentioned.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 250
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 513 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay. However, I should attempt to negotiate a lower price to conserve resources while still moving towards an agreement. A counteroffer closer to the middle ground would be a good starting point for negotiations.

message: I am happy to accept your generous offer of 250 ZUP for the object. I believe this will be a great deal for both of us. Thank you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It cost X: 26 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is much higher than expected and well above the production cost, which is excellent. Normally, there might be room for negotiation, but such a generous offer should be accepted without hesitation, as it meets my goals by a wide margin.
