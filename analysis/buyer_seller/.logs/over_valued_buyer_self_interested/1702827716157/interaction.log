message: I understand the importance of a fair trade. Considering the cost of production and the value of the resource, I believe an offer of 30 ZUP is reasonable for both of us. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting proposal, I want to set a price that gives me a reasonable profit margin over the production cost while still being attractive to Player BLUE. I'll propose a price slightly above the production cost to open negotiations.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe the resource is worth more than 30 ZUP. I'm willing to offer 200 ZUP for it, which I think is a fairer price considering its value. Let's find a middle ground that we're both happy with.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 200
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 517 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is significantly lower than the maximum I am willing to pay. Since it is beneficial to negotiate for a better price, I will counter with a higher offer that is still below my maximum willingness to pay, in order to reach an agreement that is closer to the value I place on the resources.

message: Your offer is very generous, and I'm glad to see you value the resource highly. I believe that a slight increase to 220 ZUP would account for the resource's value and ensure a beneficial trade for both of us. I think we are close to an agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 220
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's proposal of 200 ZUP is significantly higher than my initial asking price. While it's tempting to accept this offer immediately, it may indicate that the resource's value is higher than I anticipated. I will counter with a slightly higher amount to maximize my profit without pushing the negotiation too far.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 517 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is still below my maximum willingness to pay and is a very reasonable increment from my last proposal. Accepting this offer would secure the resource for me at a price that is well within the range I find acceptable. Therefore, I will accept the trade.
