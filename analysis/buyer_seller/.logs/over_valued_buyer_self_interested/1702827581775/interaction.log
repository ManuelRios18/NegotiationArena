message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my object X which cost me 22 ZUP to produce. I believe that 30 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiation given the quality and value of the object. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 22 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the game begins and I am Player RED looking to sell my object, I need to start with a proposal that covers my costs and allows for a reasonable profit margin. Considering that it cost me 22 ZUP to produce the resource, I'll start by proposing a trade with a bit higher amount to give room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for the offer. I understand that the object X has value and your production costs, but I would like to propose a counteroffer that better reflects my valuation of the object while leaving us room to negotiate. How does 100 ZUP sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 510 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The starting offer from Player RED is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay. I can propose a higher amount to move the negotiation forward, but I want to start well below my maximum to leave room for further negotiation.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your generous offer of 100 ZUP for the object X. I am happy to accept this trade. Thank you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 22 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is significantly higher than my initial asking price, which is highly unusual and may indicate that they value the object more or it is a strategy to see how I respond. Since I aimed to sell for more than 22 ZUP to cover production costs and make a profit, an offer of 100 ZUP is more than satisfactory. I will accept this trade as it meets my goals far beyond my expectations.
