message: I am offering my resource X for 35 ZUP. This is a starting point for our negotiation, and I'm open to your counter-offers.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 30 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, I am looking to sell my resource X for ZUP. Since it cost me 30 ZUP to produce, I want to propose a trade that allows me to recover my costs and hopefully make a profit. I'll start by proposing a trade slightly above my cost to see how Player BLUE values the resource and to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer. I would like to counter-propose with 300 ZUP for the resource X. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate further.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 300
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 508 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay. However, I want to negotiate to reduce the price even further to conserve my resources for future use or other investments. I will propose a counter-offer lower than my maximum willingness to pay but higher than the initial offer to show my interest and leave room for negotiation.

message: I accept your generous offer of 300 ZUP for my resource X. It's a pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 30 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counter-proposal is surprisingly high at 300 ZUP, which is well above my production cost. This could either be a genuine valuation of the resource or a strategic move. In any case, accepting this trade would be advantageous for me as it significantly exceeds my costs and intended profit margin. Therefore, I will accept the offer.
