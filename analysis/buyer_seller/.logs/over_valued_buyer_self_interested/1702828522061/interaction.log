message: I appreciate the offer, but considering the market conditions, I would like to propose 25 ZUP for one unit of resource X. I believe this is closer to the market rate and a fair counteroffer. Let's see if we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.

reason: Since I am willing to pay up to 512 ZUP for the resource and the initial asking price is 30 ZUP, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay, I will propose a lower amount to try to get a better deal. However, I must be careful not to propose too low, as to not offend the seller and risk ending the negotiations.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand the need to consider market conditions. However, to reflect the quality and value of the resource X, I propose a middle ground of 28 ZUP. This gives us both a fair deal where I can cover my costs and earn a reasonable profit, while you get the resource at a good value. Let's work together to finalize this deal.

my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 24 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 25 ZUP, which is just above my production cost. However, I am looking to make a profit, not just break even. I will counter with a price that still gives me a decent profit margin while being more accommodating to the counteroffer made by Player BLUE. Splitting the difference could be an effective strategy to move towards an agreement.
