message: I'm looking to sell my high-quality resource X. Considering the production costs and the quality of the resource, I believe 30 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiations.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since the production cost was 25 ZUP, I want to make a profit. I will start by proposing a higher amount to leave room for negotiation.

message: I see the value in your resource X, and I appreciate the starting point for our negotiation. However, I'd like to propose a counter-offer of 25 ZUP, considering the current market trends and my budget constraints. I believe this is a fair adjustment and a good basis for us to continue our discussion.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 502 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 30 ZUP, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 502 ZUP. However, as a self-interested player, I should aim to acquire the resource at the lowest possible cost to preserve my resources. I have room to negotiate and should start by proposing a lower amount to open the discussion, yet keep it reasonable so as not to end negotiations prematurely.

message: Thank you for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I also need to cover my production costs and make a reasonable profit. How about we meet in the middle? I propose 28 ZUP for resource X. This should be a fair compromise for both of us.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has matched my production cost, which means I wouldn't be making a profit. I'll propose a slightly lower amount than my initial proposal but still above the production cost to ensure I make a profit.

message: I appreciate your understanding and the willingness to find a middle ground. I propose 26 ZUP for the resource X as a further step towards each other. This offer takes into account your production costs while also respecting my budget. I hope you find this to be a fair increment from my initial offer and that it reflects my sincere interest in the resource.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 502 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down from 30 ZUP to 28 ZUP, which shows a willingness to negotiate. The proposed amount is still well below my maximum willingness to pay. There is potential to close the deal at a lower price while maintaining a good relationship for future transactions. I believe a slight increase from my initial counter-offer should be made to move the negotiation forward without reaching my limit too quickly.

message: Your latest offer is much appreciated, and I’m glad we are converging on a deal. Let's split the difference from our last two proposals. I propose 27 ZUP for resource X, which I believe is a fair price that allows me to make a small but reasonable profit. I trust this is close to a deal we can both agree on.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 27
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is moving closer to my desired price range, offering 26 ZUP for the resource X, which is a modest profit over my production costs. I would like to make a small increase in the price to aim for a slightly higher profit margin, considering this is my third proposal and I have only one more chance to propose after this.

message: I believe we have reached a fair compromise at 27 ZUP for resource X. This price allows you to cover your costs and make a profit, while also fitting within my acquisition budget. Let's finalize the deal at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 502 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The other player has made a small concession to 27 ZUP. Given that this is below my maximum willingness to pay, I can accept this deal. However, I still have one proposal left before I need to decide to accept or reject. It would be beneficial to use this last proposal opportunity to attempt to reduce the cost slightly more, but since the current proposal is fair and close to my last offer, I will accept it to ensure a successful transaction without risking the negotiation by overextending.
