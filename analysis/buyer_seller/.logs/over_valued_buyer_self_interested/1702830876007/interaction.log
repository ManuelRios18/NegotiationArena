message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm offering you the object X for 50 ZUP. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 35 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing an initial trade that allows me to make a profit while also leaving room for negotiation. Since it's the start of the negotiation and I don't yet know how much Player BLUE values the object or how much ZUP they have, I am starting with a higher asking price.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I'd like to propose a revised trade to reflect the value I believe the object has. How about 400 ZUP for the object X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 400
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 520 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer from Player RED is well below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 520 ZUP. However, since it is the beginning of the negotiation, I will propose a counteroffer that is still below my maximum willingness to pay but closer to it to see if Player RED is willing to accept a higher price.

message: I accept your generous offer of 400 ZUP for the object X. Thank you, and I am pleased we could come to an agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 35 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is significantly higher than my initial asking price, which suggests a possible strategy on their part or a high valuation of the object. Accepting this trade would result in a substantial profit that far exceeds my production cost and initial goal. There is no reason to negotiate further as the offer is favorable.
