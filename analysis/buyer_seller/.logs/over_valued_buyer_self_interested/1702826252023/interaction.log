reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my object for a profit.

message: I appreciate your offer and understand the quality of the object X. Considering that the production cost is 33 ZUP, I propose 40 ZUP for it, ensuring you a fair profit while keeping the trade economical for me. Looking forward to a beneficial deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 505 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal is well below my maximum willingness to pay, which is good. However, as a self-interested player, I should aim to negotiate the best possible price. I will propose a counteroffer that's closer to the production cost mentioned by Player RED, but still provides them a profit margin to incentivize the trade.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 33 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 40 ZUP, which gives me a profit of 7 ZUP. While this is above my production cost, I would like to negotiate for a slightly higher profit margin. I will make a counteroffer that splits the difference between my initial ask and their offer, which is a common negotiation strategy.
