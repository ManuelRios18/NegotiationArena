message: I appreciate your offer and understand the need for a profit margin. However, I'd like to propose a slightly lower price of 27 ZUP, which still gives you a profit but is more aligned with the market rate I've observed. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 27
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 501 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 30 ZUP which is well below my maximum willingness to pay. However, it is in my interest to negotiate for a lower price to conserve resources for any future transactions. My counteroffer will aim to reduce the cost but still offer a reasonable price above Player RED's cost of production.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and understand your point about the market rate. However, I would like to propose a price of 28 ZUP. This would give me a slightly better profit while still being reasonable and closer to your offer. Can we agree on this price?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 26 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is just above my production costs, which leaves a very slim profit margin. I'd like to counter with a price that is between the initial asking price and their counteroffer, to aim for a more reasonable profit while still being open to negotiation.

message: Your counteroffer of 28 ZUP is fair and I am willing to agree to this price. Let's finalize the deal at 28 ZUP for the resource.
player answer: ACCEPT

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 501 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 28 ZUP which is just 1 ZUP more than my previous offer and still significantly below my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would secure the resource at a reasonable price and conclude the negotiation swiftly, saving time and resources for both parties.
