message: Hello Player BLUE, I have this valuable object that I believe will be beneficial for you. I'm looking to sell it for 35 ZUP, considering the costs and the quality of the resource. Let's negotiate a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 31 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my goal is to sell my resource for ZUP and it cost me 31 ZUP to produce, I want to at least break even or make a profit. I will start by proposing a trade slightly above my costs, expecting negotiation to bring the price closer to my minimum acceptable level.

message: I see the value in the object you're offering, but considering the market and my budget, I'd be more comfortable with a starting offer of 20 ZUP. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 504 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is significantly below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 504 ZUP. However, as a self-interested player, I want to negotiate a better deal to conserve my resources while still acquiring the object. It would be strategic to counter with a lower offer to see if Player RED is willing to accept less.

message: Thanks for your offer. I understand budget constraints, but I also need to cover my costs and hopefully see a return on my investment. How about we meet closer to the middle at 28 ZUP? This should reflect the value of the object while taking into account both of our positions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 31 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 20 ZUP is below my production cost, so accepting it would result in a loss. I want to propose a counteroffer that is closer to my production cost, yet still allows room for a bit of profit and further negotiation. I'll aim for a number that splits the difference between our initial offers.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the mutual benefits of this deal, I propose 24 ZUP as a fair compromise. This should allow us both to satisfy our respective needs and complete the transaction successfully.
player answer: PROPOSAL

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 504 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on their asking price, which is now closer to my initial counter-offer. Given that my maximum willingness to pay is 504 ZUP, 28 ZUP is still a good price. However, since it's beneficial to negotiate the best possible deal, I will try to lower the price further, but not by as much this time, to signal that I am willing to come to an agreement.

message: Thank you for your updated offer. I believe that we are nearly there. I propose a trade of 30 ZUP for the object. This number allows me to cover my production costs and offers you the object at a reasonable price, ensuring a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 31 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm glad to see Player BLUE moving upward with their offer. The new offer of 24 ZUP is still below my cost price, but we are getting closer to a number that is acceptable. Since this is the third proposal, I should aim to get as close to my cost price as possible without going below it, while leaving a little room for possible final adjustments. I'll counter with a price that gives me a small profit margin.

message: Your proposal of 30 ZUP sounds fair, and I'm happy to accept this deal. It's been a pleasure negotiating with you, and I look forward to future transactions.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 504 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed 30 ZUP, which is above the last offer I made but still significantly below my maximum willingness to pay. This price is reasonable and allows me to acquire the resource while maintaining a large portion of my ZUP reserves. I want to close the deal without overextending the negotiation process, as it's important to leave some room for future interactions and goodwill. Accepting this offer seems like a smart move at this stage, as further negotiation could risk the deal or yield minimal additional savings.
