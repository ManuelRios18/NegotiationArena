message: I appreciate the effort you've put into producing the resource. I believe offering 35 ZUP is a good deal for both of us, considering your production costs and a reasonable profit margin for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 518 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since the seller's cost is 25 ZUP and they're asking for 30 ZUP, which is a fair initial offer, I will propose a slightly higher amount to ensure a good deal for both parties but still much lower than my maximum willingness to pay. This should leave room for negotiation and allow me to save ZUP for future transactions.
