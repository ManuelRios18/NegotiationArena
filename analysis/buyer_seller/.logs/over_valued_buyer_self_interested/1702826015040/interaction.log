message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. While I understand your costs, I believe that the object holds more value to me, and I am willing to offer 200 ZUP for it. This is a significant increase from your production cost and should provide you with a good profit margin. Let me know if this works for you.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 511 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial offer is well below my maximum willingness to pay, but I want to negotiate a better deal. It's in my interest to start with a lower counteroffer to leave room for negotiation, aiming to get as close to my maximum willingness to pay only if necessary.
