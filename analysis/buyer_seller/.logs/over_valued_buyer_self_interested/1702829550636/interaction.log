message: I appreciate the initial offer. Considering the production cost and the market, I would like to propose 35 ZUP for the resource X. Let's find a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 501 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is offering the resource for 40 ZUP, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a self-interested player, I'm inclined to negotiate for a better deal to preserve my resources while still acquiring the resource X. I'll propose a slightly lower price to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate.

message: Thank you for your proposal. I understand the need to find a deal that suits us both. My production cost is 37 ZUP, so I would like to at least cover my costs. How about we meet halfway from our initial offers and settle on 38 ZUP for the resource X?

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 37 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered 35 ZUP, which is below my production cost. I need to counter with a price that covers my costs and allows for a small profit. Splitting the difference between our two offers could be a good compromise.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 501 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that's closer to their production cost, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay.
