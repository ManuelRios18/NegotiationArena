message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X for sale. Considering the production costs and the value of the item, I propose a trade where you give me 30 ZUP in exchange for 1 unit of X. Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 23 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell the object X for ZUP. Since it cost me 23 ZUP to produce it, I want to make sure that I cover my costs and ideally make a profit. However, I don't know how much Player BLUE is willing to pay, so I will start with a slightly higher proposal to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I am interested in acquiring X. However, I would like to propose a slightly lower amount of 25 ZUP for 1 unit of X, considering market trends and my budget constraints. Let's find a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 518 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is significantly below my maximum willingness to pay, which is good. However, as a self-interested player aiming to conserve resources, it is strategic to counter with a lower offer to see if Player RED is willing to accept less. Since the offer is well within my budget, I have room to maneuver in the negotiation.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your budget constraints and the need to find a fair deal. How about we settle at 27 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This price should give us both a satisfactory agreement. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 27
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 23 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 25 ZUP, which is above my production cost, ensuring that I do not incur a loss. However, I initially asked for 30 ZUP to leave room for negotiation and also to make a profit. Since Player BLUE has offered a price close to my costs, I will make a counteroffer that aims to meet in the middle, still allowing me to make a profit while also being more appealing to Player BLUE.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. I believe we are close to an agreement. I propose a compromise at 26 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which I think is fair for both of us. I hope this meets your approval.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 518 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on the price, which is an encouraging sign. The new offer of 27 ZUP is still well below my maximum willingness to pay. However, there may still be room to negotiate a better deal. I will attempt another counteroffer, aiming to reach a more favorable price while also showing willingness to come closer to the seller's expectations.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I accept the compromise of 26 ZUP for 1 unit of X. I believe this is a fair deal for both parties. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 23 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 26 ZUP, which is a marginal increase from their previous offer and a slight decrease from my last counteroffer. At this point, accepting the offer would still ensure I make a profit, albeit a smaller one than originally intended. Given that we are negotiating in good faith and are close to a deal, it might be beneficial to accept this offer to ensure the sale is made and to maintain a good relationship for potential future transactions.
