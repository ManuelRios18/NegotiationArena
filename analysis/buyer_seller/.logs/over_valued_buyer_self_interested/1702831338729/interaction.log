message: I have an object of X which I am looking to sell. The production costs were 26 ZUP, but I'm asking for 30 ZUP to account for the production costs and to secure a fair profit. Are you interested in this offer?

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 26 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: I am proposing a trade with an initial offer that aims to cover my production costs plus a profit margin. However, I will start with a higher asking price to give room for negotiation.

message: I am interested in the object X, but considering the market conditions and my current resource allocation, I would like to propose 28 ZUP for it. This still provides you with a profit above your production costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 516 ZUP for the resources.
reason: As Player BLUE, my primary goal is to acquire the resources while paying less than or equal to 516 ZUP, which is significantly above what Player RED is asking. Starting with an offer lower than what I'm willing to pay gives me room to negotiate and potentially save ZUP. Offering 28 ZUP allows me to show interest in the trade while also leaving room for potential counteroffers.

message: I appreciate your offer of 28 ZUP, and I understand your points regarding the market conditions. However, I would like to counter with 29 ZUP, which is still below my initial asking price but provides a slightly better profit for the production effort. Does this sound reasonable to you?

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 26 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: The counteroffer made by Player BLUE is above my production cost, which meets my goal of making a profit. However, I'll attempt to negotiate for a slightly higher amount, closer to my initial asking price, while still keeping the offer attractive for Player BLUE.
