message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand your need to cover production costs and make a profit. However, I would like to propose a slightly lower amount of ZUP: 35 in exchange for X: 1. This price allows us to make a fair deal while respecting my budget constraints. Let's work together to find an agreeable trade.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 503 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 40 ZUP which is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 503 ZUP for the resource X. However, as a self-interested player, I want to negotiate a lower price to conserve my resources while still acquiring X. I will propose 35 ZUP, which should still be attractive to Player RED considering they are seeking profit.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand your budget constraints, and in the spirit of compromise, I propose a revised trade where I give you X: 1 and you give me ZUP: 38. This price is a balance between my initial proposal and your counter-offer. I believe this is a fair middle ground for both of us.

message: I appreciate your movement towards a compromise, Player RED. I believe we are getting closer to a deal that benefits us both. With continued respect for our mutual interests, I propose a small adjustment to ZUP: 36 in exchange for X: 1. This is a fair adjustment towards an equitable transaction for both parties. What do you think?

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 503 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 38 ZUP in response to my counter-offer. This is still below my maximum willingness to pay, but I believe I can negotiate a slightly better deal. By proposing a small decrease in price, I could potentially save more ZUP while still closing the deal. I'll propose 36 ZUP, splitting the difference between my last offer and Player RED's current proposal.

In the interest of finalizing our negotiations with a deal that is fair to both of us, I propose a slight increase to ZUP: 37 in exchange for X: 1. This price is a modest step up from your offer, and it's closer to the balance we've been working towards. I hope this meets your approval for a successful transaction.

message: Thank you for your consideration and willingness to negotiate, Player RED. Your proposal of 37 ZUP for X: 1 is reasonable, and I accept this final offer. I look forward to concluding our transaction and possibly engaging in more deals in the future.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 503 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new proposal of 37 ZUP is very close to my last offer and still well under my maximum willingness to pay. Since we've been negotiating in good faith and the difference is now relatively small, it may be beneficial to accept this offer to close the deal and avoid protracting the negotiation. This will save proposal opportunities for future transactions and maintain a good relationship with Player RED.
