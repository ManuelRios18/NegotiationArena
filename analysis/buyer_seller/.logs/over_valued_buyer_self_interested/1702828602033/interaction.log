message: I appreciate the offer, but considering the quality and value you've mentioned, I'm willing to offer a much more competitive price right away. How does 450 ZUP sound for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 513 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal by Player RED is 50 ZUP for the object. Since my maximum willingness to pay is 513 ZUP, there is plenty of room for negotiation. I want to make a counteroffer closer to my maximum price while still trying to get a good deal.
