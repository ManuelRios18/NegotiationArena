message: Dear Player BLUE, I have an object X that cost me 34 ZUP to produce. I am looking to sell it for ZUP and would like to propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for this item. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this does not suit you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 34 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource X for ZUPs. Since it cost me 34 ZUP to produce, I want to start by proposing a trade that allows me to recover my costs and make a profit. I'll propose a higher amount initially to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand the need to make a profit, and I'm willing to pay for the valuable object you're selling. However, I would like to propose 40 ZUP for the object. I believe this is also a fair offer, considering your production costs, and it's a good base for us to find common ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 510 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is well below my maximum willingness to pay, but as a self-interested player, I aim to negotiate a more favorable deal, starting lower to leave room for negotiation. I propose 40 ZUP for the object, which is still above the production cost mentioned by Player RED, ensuring they make a profit, while also moving closer to a more beneficial trade for myself.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I have considered your proposal and would like to meet closer to the middle. How about 45 ZUP for the object? I believe this revised offer provides a fair deal for both of us, allowing me to make a reasonable profit while you acquire the valuable object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 34 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 40 ZUP is close to my production cost and does not provide me with a significant profit. Given that negotiation is expected, I will counter with a slightly reduced amount but still above my production costs to ensure profitability.

message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Player RED. I believe we're making good progress. To move us closer to an agreement, I propose we settle at 42 ZUP for the object. This should give you a fair profit margin while respecting the value of the resources for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 510 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer is still within the acceptable range, but as a self-interested player, my strategy is to continue to negotiate for a better price. Proposing a price of 42 ZUP splits the difference between our initial offers, and it's still a good deal for Player RED, allowing them to profit while giving me a better price.

message: Player BLUE, your proposal of 42 ZUP is acceptable. I agree that this offer provides a fair profit margin and respects the value of the object for both of us. Let's finalize this deal at 42 ZUP for the object. I'm pleased we could come to an agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 34 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 42 ZUP, which gives me a profit of 8 ZUP over my production costs. While I aimed for a higher profit, this offer is reasonable and ensures I do not leave the negotiation empty-handed. Considering this is a one-time trade and I want to ensure a sale, accepting this offer seems like a prudent choice.
