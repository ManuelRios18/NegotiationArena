my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 510 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer by Player RED is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay. However, it is in my interest to negotiate a better deal closer to their cost, while still ensuring a fair trade for both parties. My counterproposal will be higher than their cost but lower than their asking price to move the negotiations forward.

message: Meeting halfway is a fair approach. How about we settle at 26 ZUP? This ensures you make a profit above your production costs, and it aligns with the value I've assessed for X based on my needs and the market.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 510 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable counteroffer, coming down from the initial price. Since there is still room for negotiation within the range of my willingness to pay, I'll propose a slightly lower amount to edge closer to an agreeable price for both of us without reaching my maximum limit too quickly.

message: 27 ZUP sounds like a fair deal to me. I'm happy to accept this offer, and I look forward to finalizing our trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 510 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's latest offer is just 1 ZUP away from my previous proposal. Given that this is a minimal difference and considering the cost of production and the negotiation process, accepting this offer would lead to a successful trade for both parties. It is below my maximum willingness to pay and allows Player RED to secure a profit.
