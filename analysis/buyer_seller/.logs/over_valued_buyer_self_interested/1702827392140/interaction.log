message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I understand your price includes production costs and profit. However, considering the market conditions and my budget, I would like to propose a counteroffer where you receive 450 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This price is closer to what I'm prepared to pay, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's discuss this further and reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 505 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price from Player RED is significantly below my maximum willingness to pay. However, since it's the beginning of the negotiation and I must act in my own self-interest, I will propose a counteroffer that is closer to my maximum willingness to pay but still offers a better deal for me, leaving room for further negotiation.
