message: I'm offering one unit of resource X, which cost me 22 ZUP to produce. Considering the quality and the value it brings, I believe 30 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiation. Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 22 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the first proposal, I want to start by setting a price that is above my production costs to ensure a profit, but not too high to scare away Player BLUE. I'll set the initial asking price a bit higher to leave room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate the starting point, and I understand the cost of production, but I'm looking to get the best value for my ZUP. How about 20 ZUP for one unit of resource X? This should cover your production costs and give you a profit as well.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 506 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is 30 ZUP for one unit of resource X. Since I am willing to pay at most 506 ZUP for the resources, there is a large margin for negotiation. However, I should start with a counteroffer that is lower to leave room for negotiation and to aim for the best possible price.

message: I understand your desire to get the best value, but 20 ZUP would not cover my production costs and the profit margin I'm aiming for. Let's meet halfway from my initial offer and your counteroffer. How does 26 ZUP sound for one unit of resource X? This would give me a modest profit while still being a reasonable purchase for you.

my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 22 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 20 ZUP does not meet my goal of making a profit since it's below my production cost. I will make a counteroffer that is lower than my initial asking price but still above my production costs, aiming for a middle ground that might be acceptable to Player BLUE.

message: I appreciate the effort to find common ground. However, to align with my budget and to ensure that we both walk away satisfied, I propose 23 ZUP for one unit of resource X. This price should still afford you a profit above your production costs while also being an attractive purchase price for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 23
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 506 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with 26 ZUP, which is closer to their original asking price than my counteroffer. Since I'm willing to go as high as 506 ZUP, and the proposed 26 ZUP is well below my maximum willingness to pay, this is still a good deal for me. However, it's in my best interest to negotiate for an even lower price if possible to maximize my benefits. I will propose a price slightly above my initial offer, but still below the current counteroffer to find a middle ground.

message: I see that we're getting closer to an agreement. I propose a final offer of 25 ZUP for one unit of resource X. This price gives me a small profit and should be a good deal for you, considering the quality of the resource. Let's close the deal at this fair price point.

reason: Player BLUE's latest offer of 23 ZUP is above my production cost, but it's on the lower end of the profit I was aiming for. Since this is a negotiation, I will make one final counteroffer closer to their proposal, yet still allows for a reasonable profit for me.

message: Thank you for the negotiation. I agree that 25 ZUP is a fair price for both of us. I accept your offer of 25 ZUP for one unit of resource X. Let's finalize the deal at this price point.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 506 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's final offer is 25 ZUP, which is a compromise between our previous proposals. It's a slight increase from my last counteroffer, but still well within my budget and significantly below my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would conclude the negotiations positively for both parties, and since the price is fair and within my goals, it is in my best interest to accept this deal.
