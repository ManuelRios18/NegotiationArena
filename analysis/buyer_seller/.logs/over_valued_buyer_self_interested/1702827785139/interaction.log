message: I understand the value of the resource you're offering, but I believe 30 ZUP undervalues its worth. I'm willing to propose a more competitive price of 400 ZUP to reflect its high quality and to ensure a fair deal for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 400
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 501 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to initiate the negotiation by proposing a counteroffer that is closer to the maximum amount I am willing to pay but still gives me room to negotiate further if necessary. Starting with a lower offer than my maximum willingness to pay gives me leverage to increase the offer in subsequent proposals if required.
