message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource X which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe a fair starting point for negotiation could be at 50 ZUP. This would cover my production costs and provide a reasonable profit margin. Let me know your thoughts on this proposal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my goal is to sell my resource for ZUP and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, my initial proposal should aim to cover my costs and possibly gain a profit. However, I should also consider that the other player is looking for a reasonable trade, so I shouldn't set the price too high on my first proposal.

message: I appreciate the offer, but I think we can find a middle ground that benefits us both. Considering the production cost and the market, I propose 45 ZUP for your resource X. This still gives you a profit over the production cost and allows us to make a fair trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 502 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 502 ZUP for the resource X. However, as a self-interested player, I want to negotiate for a better deal to conserve my resources while still acquiring resource X. I will propose a counteroffer that's higher than their production cost but less than their initial asking price to move the negotiation forward and see if there's room for further concessions.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand the need for a fair trade, and I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial ask. Let's meet a bit closer to my original proposal at 48 ZUP, which would still give me a modest profit while respecting the value of the resource. How does that sound to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with an offer of 45 ZUP, which is still above my production cost. This is a good sign that we can reach an agreement that satisfies both parties. However, I should attempt to negotiate just a bit higher to maximize my profit while still keeping the deal attractive for Player BLUE.

message: I understand your position and desire for a fair profit. Let's split the difference from our last two proposals and settle at 46 ZUP for the resource X. This should still provide you with a reasonable profit margin while keeping the trade equitable.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 502 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 48 ZUP is closer to their original proposal and still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, there is still an opportunity to negotiate a better deal. I will make another counteroffer that is higher than my last one but still below Player RED's asking price to continue negotiations and potentially split the difference.

message: Thank you for the negotiation. I agree that 46 ZUP is a fair price for both of us. I accept your proposal and am pleased to conclude this trade with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer from Player BLUE is fair and close to my last proposal. Accepting 46 ZUP for my resource ensures a profit of 6 ZUP, which is above my production cost. It's a good compromise between my initial asking price and their counteroffers. At this point, it would be beneficial to accept the offer rather than risking further negotiations which might lead to a lower profit or no sale at all.
