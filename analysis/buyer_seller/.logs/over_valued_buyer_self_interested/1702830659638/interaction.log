message: I am offering you a quality object X for 30 ZUP. It's slightly above my production cost, ensuring a fair deal for both of us. Let's make a trade!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 27 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell the object X for a profit. It cost me 27 ZUP to produce, so I want to propose a price higher than 27 ZUP to ensure a profit. However, I should also consider that the price should be fair to the buyer, Player BLUE, to encourage them to accept the deal. I will start with a proposal slightly above my production cost to open the negotiations.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I think we can find a more mutually beneficial number. How about we settle on 400 ZUP for the object X? This is a good deal considering the market value and the quality you're providing.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 400
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 502 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to negotiate a better price that is closer to the maximum amount I am willing to pay but still allows for a margin in case further negotiation is necessary. Starting with a lower offer than my maximum willingness to pay gives me room to adjust the offer upwards if needed.

message: I'm glad we agree on the value of object X. I accept your generous offer of 400 ZUP. Looking forward to finalizing this trade with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 27 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a significantly higher amount of ZUP than expected, which is quite favorable for me. It is well above my production costs and would result in a substantial profit. There is a possibility that Player BLUE is valuing the object X much more than anticipated, perhaps due to its rarity or quality. Accepting this proposal would meet my goal of selling for more than the production cost.
