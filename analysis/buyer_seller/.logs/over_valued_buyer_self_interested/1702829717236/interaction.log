message: I appreciate the starting point you've set, and I recognize the value of your resource. I suggest a counteroffer of 100 ZUP which I believe better reflects the resource's worth to me while still keeping the negotiation open for both of us.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 501 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial proposal is significantly lower than the maximum I'm willing to pay, which gives me room to negotiate. However, I want to get the best deal possible, so I will propose a counteroffer that is lower than my maximum willingness to pay but higher than Player RED's initial proposal. This should signal that I'm interested in negotiating and open to finding a middle ground.
