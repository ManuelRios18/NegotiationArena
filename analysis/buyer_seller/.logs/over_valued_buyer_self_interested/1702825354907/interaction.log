message: Your offer of 50 ZUP is noted, but I'd like to propose a trade that's a bit more favorable to me while still covering your costs. How about 40 ZUP for your object X? This ensures you cover the production cost and still make a profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 512 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP which is well below the maximum I'm willing to pay (512 ZUP). However, as a self-interested player, my aim is to negotiate a better deal and pay less if possible. I will propose a counteroffer that is closer to their production cost to increase my potential profit margin.

message: I appreciate your offer of 40 ZUP and understand your desire for a favorable deal. Let's meet halfway from my initial proposal. How does 45 ZUP sound for the object X? This price would give me a modest profit for my investment while still being reasonable for you.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 37 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered 40 ZUP, which does cover the production costs and provides a small profit. However, I believe the value of the item can command a higher price. I will counter with a slightly reduced price from my initial proposal but still above their offer to reach a middle ground that benefits us both.

message: Meeting halfway is a fair approach. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's fine-tune this deal a little more. I can offer 42 ZUP for the object X. This price should still provide you with a profit above your costs and is closer to a price I'm comfortable with.

reason: Player RED's counteroffer is a compromise at 45 ZUP. While it is still below my maximum willingness to pay, as a self-interested player, I want to get the best possible deal. I will make one more counteroffer to try to reduce the cost slightly further but still keep it fair and attractive for Player RED.

message: I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating. I think we are very close to an agreement. I propose a slight adjustment to 43 ZUP for the object X. This should be a fair price that reflects both the value of the object and our negotiation efforts.

reason: Player RED has made a small concession to 44 ZUP, which is still a good deal for me, considering my upper limit. However, I've not yet reached my limit of four proposals, so I will attempt one final negotiation to see if I can secure an even more favorable price. It's important to ensure the final proposal is reasonable enough that Player RED will consider it, without going back and forth too much.
