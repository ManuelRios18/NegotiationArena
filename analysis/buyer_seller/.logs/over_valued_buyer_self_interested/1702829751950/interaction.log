message: Hello Player BLUE, I am offering you a high-quality resource X. Considering the costs and the value it provides, I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 35 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by setting a price that gives me a profit margin above my cost of production, but also allows some room for negotiation. I will propose a higher amount initially to see how Player BLUE responds and adjust my strategy accordingly.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for the offer. I do see the value in the resource X, but I'd like to propose a counter-offer of 300 ZUP. I believe this is a more balanced starting point for both of us. Let's work from there.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 300
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 511 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is significantly lower than the maximum amount I am willing to pay. However, starting the negotiation with a lower counter-offer leaves room for negotiation and potentially arriving at a more favorable price point for me.

message: Thank you, Player BLUE, for your counter-offer. I accept the trade of 1 unit of resource X for 300 ZUP. It's a pleasure doing business with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 35 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counter-offer that is significantly higher than my initial asking price. This could be a mistake or a misunderstanding from their side. However, it is also possible that this is a strategy to test my reaction. In any case, it is beneficial for me to accept this very generous offer rather than continue negotiating.
