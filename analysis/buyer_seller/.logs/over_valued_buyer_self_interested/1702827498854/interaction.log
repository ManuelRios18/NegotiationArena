my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my goal is to sell the resource for ZUP, and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I want to start with a proposal that allows me to recoup my costs and make a profit. I'll propose a trade where I ask for more than 40 ZUP to start the negotiation.

message: I appreciate the quality of the resource you're offering. Let's make it a more attractive deal for both of us. How about I offer you 200 ZUP for it?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 200
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 517 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 50 ZUP for the resource is well below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 517 ZUP. However, it is in my interest to negotiate the best possible deal. I will propose a higher trade to indicate my interest without revealing my maximum willingness to pay and to move the negotiation forward.
