message: I understand your need for a profit margin, but I believe a slightly lower price will provide a fair deal for both of us, considering the current market conditions. How about 38 ZUP for one unit of X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 504 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 40 ZUP, which is slightly above their production costs. This is a reasonable starting point, but as a self-interested player, I aim to negotiate a better price, closer to their cost, to maximize my own profits. I will propose a lower price that is still above their cost to move the negotiation forward.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer and understand the market conditions. However, I believe that a middle ground of 39 ZUP for one unit of X would be a win-win for both of us, ensuring I cover production costs and receive a modest profit, while you get a fair price on the item.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 39
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 37 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is just above my production cost, which is acceptable, but I'd like to counter with a slightly higher amount to try to maximize my profit. A compromise at 39 ZUP would still be a fair deal for both and is closer to my initial asking price.

message: I agree that 39 ZUP for one unit of X is a fair compromise. It covers your production costs and gives you a profit, while being an acceptable price for me. Let's proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 504 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer is very close to my initial counteroffer, suggesting they are motivated to close the deal. The proposed price of 39 ZUP is still within a reasonable range and allows for a profitable transaction on my part, as it is well below my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer could save time and resources that might be spent on prolonged negotiations.
