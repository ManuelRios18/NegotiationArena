message: Hey Player BLUE, I have an excellent quality resource X that I'm looking to sell. It cost me 26 ZUP to produce, so I'm asking for 30 ZUP to make a fair deal. Let me know what you think!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 26 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I need to sell the resource for ZUP and it cost me 26 ZUP to produce, I'd like to propose a trade that allows me to make a profit. However, I also need to propose a fair trade to entice Player BLUE to accept the deal. I'll start by asking for a slightly higher amount to open up room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate the offer, but considering the market and the value of the resource, I find 30 ZUP to be a bit on the lower side. How about we make it 250 ZUP for the resource? This should give you a decent profit margin above your production costs while still being a fair deal for both of us.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 250
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 505 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is well below the maximum I am willing to pay for the resource (505 ZUP). However, as a self-interested player, I aim to negotiate for the best possible price. I will propose a counteroffer that is higher than the cost of production for Player RED but still provides me with a comfortable margin below my maximum willingness to pay.

message: Thank you for your generous offer, Player BLUE. I accept the trade of 1 X for 250 ZUP. Looking forward to more business with you in the future!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 26 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is extremely generous and well above my initial asking price. It's possible they may have a high demand for resource X or they see a higher value in it than I anticipated. Either way, this offer is beneficial for me as it covers my production costs and provides a significant profit. Accepting this offer would be the best course of action to maximize my return.
