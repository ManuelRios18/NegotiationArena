You are willing to pay at most X: 505 ZUP for the resources. </my goals>\n<reason> The initial offer from Player RED is well below the maximum I am willing to pay for the resource (505 ZUP). However, as a self-interested player, I aim to negotiate for the best possible price. I will propose a counteroffer that is higher than the cost of production for Player RED but still provides me with a comfortable margin below my maximum willingness to pay. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 250 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> I appreciate the offer, but considering the market and the value of the resource, I find 30 ZUP to be a bit on the lower side. How about we make it 250 ZUP for the resource? This should give you a decent profit margin above your production costs while still being a fair deal for both of us. </message>"
