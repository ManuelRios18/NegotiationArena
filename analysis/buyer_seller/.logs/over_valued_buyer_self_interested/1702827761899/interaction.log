message: I'm offering my high-quality object X for just 30 ZUP. This is a great deal considering the production effort and cost involved. Let's make a deal!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 20 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing an initial trade that would allow me to cover my production costs and make a profit. The starting price should be high enough to give room for negotiation but not too high to deter Player BLUE from negotiating.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 500 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial offer of 30 ZUP for their object X is well below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 500 ZUP. It's a favorable deal, and it would be in my interest to accept it without further negotiation to secure a good price for the object X.
