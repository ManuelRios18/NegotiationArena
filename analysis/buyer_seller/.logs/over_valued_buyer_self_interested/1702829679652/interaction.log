message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. In the interest of a fair negotiation, I would like to make a counteroffer. I propose that I give you 250 ZUP for 1 X. This is a significant increase from your production cost and should offer you a good profit margin. Let's work together to reach an agreement that's beneficial for both of us.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 520 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is significantly below the maximum I'm willing to pay. However, the goal is to negotiate the best possible price. It's beneficial to propose a counteroffer that is lower than my maximum willingness to pay, but still within a reasonable range to continue negotiations and aim for a middle ground.
