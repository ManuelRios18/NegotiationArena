message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I appreciate the quality of the object, but considering my budget, I'd like to propose a trade where I give you 30 ZUP for the object X. Let's work together to find a fair price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 511 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a self-interested negotiator, my objective is to acquire the object at the lowest possible price. I will counter with a lower offer to create room for negotiation, aiming to reach an agreement closer to my ideal price range, which is less than the maximum I'm willing to pay.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your budget constraints, but I need to cover my costs and make a profit. How about we meet halfway? I propose 40 ZUP for object X. This would give us both a fair deal. What do you say?

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 30 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer matches my production cost, which means I wouldn't make a profit. I need to counter with a higher amount to ensure a profit is made, but not too high so as to discourage further negotiation. I'll aim for a middle ground.

message: I see your point, Player RED, and I'm willing to come up from my initial offer. Let's move closer to your asking price. I propose 35 ZUP for object X. I believe this would still provide a fair and equitable arrangement for both of us.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 511 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a request to meet halfway at 40 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. Although this is closer to a fair middle ground, I believe there is still room to negotiate for a slightly better deal for myself. I will make a second counteroffer, increasing my previous offer slightly to show my willingness to negotiate while still trying to keep the final price as advantageous for me as possible.
