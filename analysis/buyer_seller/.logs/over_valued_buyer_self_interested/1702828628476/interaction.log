message: I have an object that might interest you. It's cost me a bit to produce, so I'm looking for a fair price that compensates for the production costs and gives me a small profit. How does 30 ZUP sound for this item?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 26 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the first proposal, I want to set a starting price that gives me a profit margin while still being reasonable to open negotiations with Player BLUE. I will propose a price slightly above my production cost, expecting that Player BLUE may want to negotiate for a lower price.

message: I'm interested in the object, but I think it's worth a bit more than 30 ZUP. How about I offer 50 ZUP for it instead? That should cover your costs and provide a reasonable profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 501 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 30 ZUP for the item is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 501 ZUP. However, it's in my interest to negotiate the best possible deal. I will propose a slightly higher price to show my interest without revealing my maximum willingness to pay, thereby leaving room for further negotiation if necessary.

message: I'm pleased with your offer of 50 ZUP for the object. I accept this trade. Thank you for the smooth negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 26 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered a price which is well above my production cost and also beyond the price I initially proposed. This is a favorable outcome for me as it meets my goal of selling the resource for more than it cost to produce. Accepting this offer would give me a substantial profit.
