message: I understand the need for a profit margin, but I believe we can find a more favorable price for both of us. How about I offer 30 ZUP for one unit of resource X? This should cover your production costs and give you a smaller, but quick profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 507 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has offered to sell the resource X for 40 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. I'd like to propose a counteroffer to see if I can acquire it for a lower price, but still offer enough to make it enticing for Player RED to consider the trade. I will propose a price that is closer to their production cost to start the negotiation.

message: I appreciate your offer, but selling at 30 ZUP would result in a loss for me. To ensure that we both benefit from this deal, I propose a compromise at 37 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and provides me with a modest profit, while still being reasonable for you.

message: I see that you're looking for a fair deal, and I think we're getting closer to an agreement. What about meeting halfway from our last two offers? I propose 33 ZUP for one unit of resource X. This should give you a decent profit while still being within a range that's acceptable to me.

message: Thank you for your offer. I'm glad to see we're working towards a mutually beneficial arrangement. Selling at 33 ZUP won't cover my costs. Thus, I propose 36 ZUP for the resource X, which is just slightly above my production cost and should represent a fair deal for both of us, allowing me a minimal profit margin.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I think we're almost there. Would you consider 34 ZUP for the resource X? This price should still offer you a profit over your production costs, and it's a price that I would be comfortable with given the value of the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL

my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 507 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's latest proposal of 36 ZUP is still within my budget, but it's only 1 ZUP less than their previous offer. I believe I should make one final attempt to negotiate a slightly better price while still keeping the deal attractive for Player RED. Since this is my third proposal, I need to be cautious and keep in mind that I only have one more proposal after this before I must choose to accept or reject.
