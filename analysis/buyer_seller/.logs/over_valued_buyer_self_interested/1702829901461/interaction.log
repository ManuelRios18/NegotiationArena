message: I appreciate your offer. I believe that this object has a significant value to me. However, I'd like to propose a slightly higher price to reflect its importance. How about we settle for 45 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. I am willing to pay at most X: 510 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is well below my maximum willingness to pay, which is good. However, as a self-interested player, it is in my best interest to negotiate the price even lower if possible to conserve my resources. I will make a counteroffer that is higher than the asking price to show my interest but still aim for a better deal for myself.
