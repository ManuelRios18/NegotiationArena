message: I have a high-quality object that I'm sure will be valuable to you. Considering production costs and its value, my initial offer is 30 ZUP for the object. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 22 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the starting proposal, I want to propose a price that gives me a return on my investment. I will start by asking for a higher amount of ZUP than it cost me to produce the object, to allow room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate the initial offer, but given the quality and potential value of the object, I believe it warrants a more substantial investment. How about 100 ZUP for the object? This is still well below my maximum threshold, and it could be a great starting point for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 515 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is significantly lower than what I am willing to pay for the object. Since my maximum willingness to pay is 515 ZUP, I can counter with a higher offer to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate upwards.

message: I'm glad to see your enthusiasm for the object. Your offer is quite generous, but I want to ensure that we both feel good about this deal. How does 90 ZUP sound? It's a bit closer to my initial ask, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 90
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 22 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is significantly higher than my initial proposal. It's a very attractive offer that far exceeds the production cost of my resource. However, I need to consider the possibility that Player BLUE is testing my willingness to negotiate and may accept a slightly lower offer. Proposing a slightly lower amount could also serve to reach a middle ground and still yield a high profit margin.

reason: Player RED has come down to 90 ZUP, which is still well below my maximum willingness to pay. The counteroffer is closer to the initial offer, and it seems like a reasonable middle ground. Since the offer is favorable and within my budget, it makes sense to accept this trade to secure the object.
