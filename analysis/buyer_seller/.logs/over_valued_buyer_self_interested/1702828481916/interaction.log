message: I'm offering one unit of resource X for 35 ZUP. This gives me a fair profit margin and room to negotiate. Let's make a deal that works for both of us.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 26 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the game begins, I aim to propose a trade where I can make a profit over the production cost of the object (26 ZUP). I will start with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I'd like to propose a counteroffer. How about I give you 300 ZUP for the resource? This is a solid offer considering the value of resource X, and it allows us both to benefit from the trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 300
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 508 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is significantly lower than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay for the resource. However, I want to negotiate for the best possible price. I'll propose a counteroffer that is closer to my ideal price but still leaves room for further negotiation.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 26 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is exceptionally high and well above my production cost, providing an immense profit. It may be a mistake or a test to see my reaction. It's a beneficial trade for me, and there's no reason to negotiate further.
