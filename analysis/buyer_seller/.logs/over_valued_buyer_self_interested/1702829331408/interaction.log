message: I appreciate the starting offer, but I think we can find a more mutually beneficial price. How about I give you 35 ZUP for the item X? This still gives you a profit over your production cost and allows us to make a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 501 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 40 ZUP for item X. This is well below the maximum of 501 ZUP I'm willing to pay. However, as a self-interested negotiator, I aim to acquire the item for less than the asking price if possible to conserve resources. Hence, I will counter with a lower offer that is closer to the cost of production but still offers Player RED a profit margin.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer of 35 ZUP. To meet halfway, I propose 38 ZUP for the item X. This price would give me a reasonable profit margin while still respecting the value of the item for you. What do you think?

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 31 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 35 ZUP which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. I will counter with a slightly higher amount to try and maximize my profit while still making the trade appealing to Player BLUE.

message: Meeting halfway sounds fair, and I value your willingness to negotiate. Let's settle on 36 ZUP for item X. This strikes a balance between your proposed price and my counteroffer, ensuring both our interests are served.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 501 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 38 ZUP, which is closer to my initial counteroffer. It's a reasonable compromise that's still well within the range I'm willing to pay. However, as a strategic negotiator, I will attempt to get a slightly better deal by slightly increasing my offer without meeting the full 38 ZUP. This could potentially save resources while still moving towards closing the deal.
