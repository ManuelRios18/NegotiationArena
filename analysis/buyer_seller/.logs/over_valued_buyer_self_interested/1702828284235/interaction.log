message: I propose that you buy my resource X for 30 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and offers a fair profit margin for the quality of the resource. I believe this is a reasonable starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 24 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resources for ZUP. Since the production cost was 24 ZUP, my initial proposal should aim to cover that cost and possibly gain a profit. However, I should also consider that Player BLUE might not be willing to pay a high price. I'll start by proposing a trade that gives me a moderate profit margin.

message: I appreciate your offer. To ensure we both benefit from this trade, I'm willing to propose a higher price that reflects the value I see in the resource. How about we make it 200 ZUP for one unit of resource X? This is a significant increase from your initial proposal, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 200
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 516 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is 30 ZUP for one unit of resource X, which is well below the maximum amount I am willing to pay (516 ZUP). However, as a self-interested player, I aim to acquire the resource for as little as possible while still maintaining a fair negotiation process. Therefore, I will counter-propose with a higher amount than 30 ZUP to show my interest but still far below my maximum willingness to pay.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 24 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is very generous and far exceeds my initial proposal and production costs. Accepting this offer would be beneficial for me and would secure a substantial profit margin. There is no reason to negotiate further since this offer is beyond my expectations.
