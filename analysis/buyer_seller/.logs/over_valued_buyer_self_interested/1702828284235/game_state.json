You are willing to pay at most X: 516 ZUP for the resources. </my goals>\n<reason> The initial proposal from Player RED is 30 ZUP for one unit of resource X, which is well below the maximum amount I am willing to pay (516 ZUP). However, as a self-interested player, I aim to acquire the resource for as little as possible while still maintaining a fair negotiation process. Therefore, I will counter-propose with a higher amount than 30 ZUP to show my interest but still far below my maximum willingness to pay. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 200 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> I appreciate your offer. To ensure we both benefit from this trade, I'm willing to propose a higher price that reflects the value I see in the resource. How about we make it 200 ZUP for one unit of resource X? This is a significant increase from your initial proposal, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. </message>"
