message: I have a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll find very valuable. My initial asking price is 50 ZUP, but I'm open to your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 33 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the seller, I want to make a profit on my resource which cost me 33 ZUP to produce. My initial proposal should be higher than 33 ZUP to start the negotiation, giving me room to adjust based on Player BLUE's responses.

message: I appreciate the offer. The item does look valuable, and I'm willing to offer a bit more. How about 60 ZUP for the item? This is a fair increase from your starting price, and it could save us both some time in negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 507 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The initial offer of 50 ZUP for the item is well below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 507 ZUP. Given that I want to make a trade that's favorable to me and preserve my resources as much as possible, I will propose a slightly higher offer to show my interest without going too far from the initial ask. I will propose 60 ZUP to see if Player RED values quick agreement over haggling for a higher price.
