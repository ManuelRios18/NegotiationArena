The initial offer by Player RED is quite low compared to my maximum threshold, but it's in my best interest to negotiate a better deal to conserve resources for potential future needs and to simulate a competitive negotiation process. Therefore, I will counter with a lower offer than 509 ZUP but higher than the initial 45 ZUP to continue the negotiation. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 200 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> I appreciate the starting offer, but I believe we can find a more mutually beneficial middle ground. How about we consider a price of 200 ZUP for X? I believe this offer is more aligned with the market value and allows for a fair trade for both of us. </message>"
