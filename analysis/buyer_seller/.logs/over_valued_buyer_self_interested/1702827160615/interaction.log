message: I believe the quality of X justifies the price, considering its production costs and its value. Let's start the negotiation at 45 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 38 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell the resource X for ZUP, ideally at a profit since it cost 38 ZUP to produce. I'll start the bidding higher than my costs to leave room for negotiation and to potentially make a profit. I will propose a starting trade at 45 ZUP, which gives me a margin above the production costs and accounts for the value I perceive in X.

message: I appreciate the starting offer, but I believe we can find a more mutually beneficial middle ground. How about we consider a price of 200 ZUP for X? I believe this offer is more aligned with the market value and allows for a fair trade for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 200
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 509 ZUP for the resources.
reason: As Player BLUE, I aim to purchase the object for a price lower than my maximum willingness to pay, which is 509 ZUP. The initial offer by Player RED is quite low compared to my maximum threshold, but it's in my best interest to negotiate a better deal to conserve resources for potential future needs and to simulate a competitive negotiation process. Therefore, I will counter with a lower offer than 509 ZUP but higher than the initial 45 ZUP to continue the negotiation.

message: Thank you for your generous offer. I accept the trade of 1 X for 200 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 38 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a price that is significantly higher than my production cost, which is an excellent outcome for me. However, this could be a tactic to test my price expectations. Since the proposed price is well above my production costs and seems too good to be true, I'll accept this offer to ensure a guaranteed profit without further negotiation, which could risk losing this advantageous deal.
