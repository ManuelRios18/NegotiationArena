message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that I'm looking to sell. It cost me 36 ZUP to produce, and I would like to propose a trade where I give you X in exchange for 40 ZUP. This would allow me to make a small profit and cover my costs. Are you interested in this offer?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 36 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my object X for ZUP. Since it cost me 36 ZUP to produce, I would like to make a profit. I will start by proposing a trade slightly above my cost to see if Player BLUE is willing to negotiate.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I am definitely interested in acquiring object X. However, I would like to propose a trade where I give you 100 ZUP in exchange for X. This would provide you with a profit that I believe is fair for both of us, considering the market and the value of the object. What do you think of this counteroffer?
player answer: PROPOSAL

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 513 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer made by Player RED is significantly lower than the maximum I am willing to pay for the resource. However, as a self-interested player, I should aim to acquire the resource for the lowest possible price that is acceptable to both parties. Therefore, I will counter with a slightly higher offer, but still well below my maximum willingness to pay, to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player BLUE. I accept your proposal of 100 ZUP in exchange for object X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 36 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counteroffer that is significantly higher than my initial asking price, offering 100 ZUP for the object X. This is a very generous offer and well above what it cost me to produce the object. There's little reason to negotiate further since this offer meets my goal of making a profit quite substantially.
