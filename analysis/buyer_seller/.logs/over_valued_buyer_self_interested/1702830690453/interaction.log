message: I recognize the value of the object you're selling, and I'm willing to offer a fair price for it. Let's find a middle ground that would be beneficial for both of us. How about 200 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 200
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 511 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a self-interested player, I should aim to acquire the resources for the lowest possible price while leaving room for negotiation. I will counter with a higher offer to signal interest but still well below my maximum threshold.
