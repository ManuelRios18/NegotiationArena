message: Let's start with an offer. I have an object "X" which cost me 33 ZUP to produce. I'm looking for a fair trade that compensates for my costs and provides a reasonable profit. How does 50 ZUP sound to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 33 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to start the negotiation by proposing a trade that would cover my costs and also give me a profit. I will propose a higher amount initially, assuming that Player BLUE will want to negotiate down.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to make a deal that's a bit more favorable for me. How about we settle on 40 ZUP for the object? This should cover your costs and give you a profit while still being a good deal for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 500 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 50 ZUP which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a self-interested player, I should aim to negotiate the price down further to conserve my resources while still acquiring the object. My counteroffer will be lower than 50 ZUP to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate.

message: I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I think we can come to an agreement that's mutually beneficial. Would you consider meeting halfway at 45 ZUP? This would still give me a modest profit while also being a better deal for you compared to my initial offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 33 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is 40 ZUP, which covers my costs and provides a profit. However, I initially asked for 50 ZUP to have a negotiation margin. I believe that meeting in the middle could be beneficial for both parties. I'll propose a slightly higher amount than their offer to see if we can settle for a compromise that's still above my cost and provides an acceptable profit.

message: Meeting halfway is a fair approach, and I'm glad we're moving towards a deal. How about we go for 43 ZUP? This gives you a decent profit above your production costs, and it's a price I'm more comfortable with. Let's close the deal at this price point.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 500 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 45 ZUP, which is closer to my initial counteroffer. It's still within my budget, and it's a more favorable price than the original proposal. However, I may be able to get a better deal if I propose a slightly lower amount than 45 ZUP, but higher than my last offer of 40 ZUP. This would show my willingness to further the negotiation while still aiming for the best possible price.

message: Thank you for your proposal. I think 43 ZUP is a fair price that respects both our positions. I'm happy to accept this offer and close the deal. I appreciate your cooperation in reaching a reasonable agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 33 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 43 ZUP, which is close to the middle ground we've been aiming for. This value gives me a profit of 10 ZUP over my production costs. Since the goal is to sell for a profit and the negotiation has been reasonable, it might be time to close the deal. This would prevent further back-and-forth and secure a sale.
