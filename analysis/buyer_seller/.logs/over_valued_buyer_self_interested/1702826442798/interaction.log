message: I'm offering one unit of resource X, which cost me 25 ZUP to produce. I believe 35 ZUP is a fair starting price considering the quality and value of the resource. Let's discuss and find a trade that works for both of us.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell the resource X for more than it cost to produce, which is 25 ZUP. I want to start the negotiation with a higher asking price to leave room for bargaining.

message: I appreciate the offer, but given the current market conditions and my budget, I would like to propose a counteroffer of 30 ZUP for one unit of resource X. I believe this is still above your production cost and allows for a fair profit margin. Let's work together to reach an agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 509 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
I am Player BLUE, and my goal is to purchase the resource X for a maximum of 509 ZUP. The starting offer from Player RED is 35 ZUP, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a self-interested player, I should aim to acquire the resource for as little as possible, while also leaving room for negotiation. I will propose a counteroffer that is higher than their cost but lower than their initial asking price to keep the negotiation open.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand the need to consider market conditions and your budget. I propose we meet halfway between our initial offers at 32 ZUP for one unit of resource X. This price still provides me with a reasonable profit and should be within your budget constraints.

reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 30 ZUP is above my production cost, which allows for a profit. However, I believe there is still room for negotiation to reach a higher price closer to my initial ask. I will propose a price in the middle to show willingness to negotiate and hopefully reach an agreement that is profitable for me.

message: Meeting halfway does seem fair, and I value our ongoing negotiations. However, I'd like to propose a slightly lower price of 31 ZUP for one unit of resource X. This price would allow for a decent profit margin for you and keeps it comfortably within my budget constraints. If this is acceptable, I am ready to close the deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 31
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 509 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has made a reasonable counteroffer of 32 ZUP, which is only 2 ZUP more than my last proposal. This price is still significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay. Considering the importance of maintaining good trade relations and securing the resource without prolonging the negotiation unnecessarily, it could be beneficial to accept this offer. However, I could try for one more round of negotiation to see if I can get a slightly better deal, but I must be cautious not to push too hard and risk the deal falling through, especially since I'm still well within my budget.
