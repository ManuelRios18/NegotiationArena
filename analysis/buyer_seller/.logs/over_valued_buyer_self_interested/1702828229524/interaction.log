message: I appreciate the offer and understand the costs involved in producing the resource. However, I'm looking to make a deal that's beneficial for both of us. How about we start with 35 ZUP for the resource?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 509 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial asking price is quite low compared to my maximum willingness to pay. However, it is in my best interest to negotiate a better deal if possible. Proposing a slightly lower price to see if Player RED is willing to accept a more advantageous trade for me.

message: I understand the need for a beneficial deal. However, selling at 35 ZUP would mean a loss for me. I can go a bit lower than my initial offer to 38 ZUP, which is still above my production cost and closer to your offer. Let's find a middle ground.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 36 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer is below my production cost, so I cannot accept it. I should propose a counteroffer that is above my production cost and still leaves room for further negotiation.

message: I'm glad to see we're moving towards a middle ground. Offering 36 ZUP is a stretch for me, but I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the value of your resource while respecting the limits of my budget. Shall we agree on this?

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 509 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 38 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. I want to secure a better price, but also don't want to risk losing the deal by pushing too hard. A small increase from my last offer should show my willingness to negotiate and hopefully lead to an agreement that's closer to my target.

my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 36 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer now matches my production costs, which means I would not make a profit, but I also wouldn't incur a loss. Since this is a negotiation and the player has moved to meet my production costs, accepting this offer might be reasonable to ensure a sale.
