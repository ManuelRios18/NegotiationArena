message: I have a high-quality object X for sale, which could be very beneficial for you. It cost me 37 ZUP to produce. I'm looking for a fair trade that reflects its value and would like to propose a trade for 50 ZUP. Let's make a deal that works for both of us!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 37 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the initial proposal, I aim to start with a trade that allows me to recover the production costs of my resource X and possibly get a profit. I'm proposing a higher amount to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer. I understand that the object X is of high quality and that you're seeking a fair trade. However, I'd like to propose a different amount. Considering market conditions and my current resource allocation, I am willing to offer 40 ZUP for object X. I believe this is a reasonable starting point for negotiations. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 504 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The initial proposal from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay for the object, which is set at 504 ZUP. However, as a self-interested player, I should aim to acquire the object for as little as possible to preserve my resources. Starting with a counteroffer that is significantly less than my maximum limit gives me room to negotiate and potentially reach an agreement that is more favorable to me. Therefore, I am going to propose a lower amount, which still gives Player RED a profit margin but is more cost-effective for me.

message: I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate. I understand your position and would like to meet you halfway. Let's settle on 45 ZUP for the object X. This price would allow us both to benefit from the trade, considering the quality and production costs. What do you say?

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 37 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 40 ZUP is above my production cost, which is good, but I believe I can negotiate for a slightly higher amount to gain a better profit. I will counter-propose with a value that gives us both room to find a middle ground.

message: I appreciate your consideration and the adjustment in your proposal. I am happy to see that we are moving toward a common ground. With respect to both the quality of the object and your production costs, I propose 42 ZUP for object X. I believe this offer is fair and brings us closer to finalizing this deal. I hope this demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement that serves both of our interests.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 504 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has made a concession by moving closer to my initial offer, which indicates a willingness to compromise. The new offer of 45 ZUP is still well below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as I am self-interested and looking to conserve resources, I will make another counteroffer, inching closer to RED's price but still aiming for a better deal for myself. By proposing a slightly higher price than my initial offer, I leave room for further negotiation, should it be necessary.
