message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of resource X in exchange for 40 ZUP. This price accounts for the production cost and a reasonable margin. Let's discuss if this works for you or if we need to adjust the terms.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource X for ZUP. It costed X: 36 ZUP to produce the resource
reason: I'm initiating the trade by proposing a selling price slightly higher than my production cost to cover potential negotiation and to gain some profit.

message: Thank you for the proposal. Considering the value of resource X and to make this deal more balanced, I would like to propose giving 200 ZUP in exchange for 1 unit of X. Please let me know if this is acceptable or if we need further adjustments.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 200
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 500 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is quite low compared to my maximum willingness to pay, which is 500 ZUP for 1 unit of X. However, I want to propose a slightly higher amount to see if Player RED has room to negotiate upwards, potentially indicating the real value they place on the resource X.

message: Thank you for your generous counter-proposal of 200 ZUP for 1 unit of X. I am happy to accept this offer. It's a pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource X for ZUP. It costed X: 36 ZUP to produce the resource
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is significantly higher than expected, which is a favorable outcome. Accepting this proposal would result in a substantial profit far exceeding the production cost.
