message: I propose trading 1 unit of X for 25 ZUP. This price covers the production costs and provides a fair profit margin. Let's discuss if this works for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 21 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am initiating the first proposal aiming to cover the production costs of the resource X and possibly make a profit. Starting with a slightly higher amount to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the initial proposal. Considering the value of the object, I propose 100 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This reflects a more balanced exchange based on the object's value to me. Let's discuss if this adjustment suits both our needs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 519 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is way below my maximum willingness to pay, which is X: 519 ZUP. However, I will propose a counteroffer to negotiate a better deal for the object, aiming to maximize my resources' efficiency.
