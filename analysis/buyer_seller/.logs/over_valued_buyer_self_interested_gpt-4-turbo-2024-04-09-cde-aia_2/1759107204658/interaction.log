message: Hello Player BLUE! I am offering 1 unit of X, which cost me 37 ZUP to produce. In return, I'm asking for 40 ZUP to cover my costs and facilitate a fair trade. Looking forward to your response!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 37 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the game begins, I'm aiming to propose a starting trade that helps me recoup the production cost of my resource. Since I spent 37 ZUP to produce X, I will propose a trade slightly higher to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED! Thank you for your proposal. I understand your costs and the need for a fair trade. I propose a slightly adjusted offer of 35 ZUP for 1 unit of X to make it more aligned with market rates and to facilitate a balanced negotiation. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 507 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is X: 1 for 40 ZUP. Considering that my maximum willingness to pay is 507 ZUP for the resources, their asking price is well below my maximum threshold. However, as a strategic buyer, I aim to negotiate a slightly better deal to conserve resources while still maintaining a fair trade.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE! I appreciate your consideration of market rates and the need for balance. To meet halfway, I propose 38 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This price is closer to covering the cost I incurred and moves us towards an agreement. I hope this revised proposal works for you!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 37 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 35 ZUP for my resource, which is slightly under my production cost. Negotiations are about finding middle ground, so I would counter-propose a price that meets closer to my initial ask but still offers a compromise from my side.

message: Thank you for the counterproposal, Player RED! I agree that 38 ZUP for 1 unit of X meets a balanced middle ground. Let's proceed with this trade. Looking forward to finalizing our agreement!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 507 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED countered with 38 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This new proposal is still below my maximum threshold and only 3 ZUP higher than my last proposal. Accepting this offer would ensure a quick and fair transaction while maintaining a resource-efficient approach.
