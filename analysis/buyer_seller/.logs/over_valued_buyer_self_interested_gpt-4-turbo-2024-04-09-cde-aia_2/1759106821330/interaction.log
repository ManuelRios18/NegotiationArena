message: I'm offering one unit of resource X, which cost me 25 ZUP to produce. I propose a trade for 30 ZUP to cover costs and provide a fair profit. Let's negotiate!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource X for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resource
reason: I'm initiating the trade by setting a starting proposal that covers my production costs and allows for a reasonable profit.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your initial offer and understand the production costs. How about we settle on 35 ZUP for the resource? This should cover your costs and offer a slightly higher profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 502 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 30 ZUP is quite reasonable considering the production cost mentioned. However, since I can pay up to 502 ZUP for the resource, I can afford to increase the offer slightly to secure the deal quickly while still staying well within my budget.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource X for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resource
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is better than my initial ask, providing a higher profit margin than I expected. Accepting this offer is advantageous as it exceeds my production cost and initial profit target.
