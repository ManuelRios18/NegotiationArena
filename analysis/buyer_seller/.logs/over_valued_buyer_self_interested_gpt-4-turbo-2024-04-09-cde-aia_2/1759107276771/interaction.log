message: I am offering one unit of X for 45 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and includes a reasonable profit margin. Let's negotiate if this doesn't align with your expectations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 39 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm starting the negotiation by proposing a trade that covers my production costs plus a small profit. This gives room for negotiation and adjustment based on the response from Player BLUE.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your initial offer. Would you consider reducing the price to 40 ZUP for one unit of X? This could help in keeping my costs lower while still covering your production and ensuring a profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 512 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 45 ZUP for one unit of X, which is very reasonable given my maximum willingness to pay is 512 ZUP. I will attempt to negotiate a slightly better deal to preserve more of my resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your proposal. I understand the importance of managing costs and would like to meet halfway. How about we settle at 42 ZUP for one unit of X? This price slightly adjusts for both our needs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 39 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE proposed to buy at 40 ZUP, which is slightly above my production cost but lower than my initial asking price. I'll counter with a slightly higher amount to aim for a middle ground, ensuring a better profit margin while still being reasonable.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for meeting me halfway. I agree to the price of 42 ZUP for one unit of X. This works well for us both. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 512 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a compromise of 42 ZUP, which is very close to my last offer and still well under my maximum willingness to pay of 512 ZUP. Accepting this offer would secure the resources I need without significantly affecting my budget.
