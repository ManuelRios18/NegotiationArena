Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your initial proposal. To move things along swiftly, I propose 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This offer takes into consideration both the value of the resource and a reasonable margin for you. Let me know if this adjusted offer works for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 507 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 30 ZUP for 1 unit of X is significantly less than my maximum willingness to pay, which is 507 ZUP. I will propose a slightly higher amount to secure the deal while remaining well within my budget.
