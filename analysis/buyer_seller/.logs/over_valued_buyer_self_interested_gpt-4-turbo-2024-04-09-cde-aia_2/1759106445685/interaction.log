message: I would like to propose a trade. I'll give you one unit of X in exchange for 35 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and provides a reasonable margin. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 30 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Starting with a reasonable proposal to open negotiations, asking for a bit more than the production cost to make a profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer. To make it align better with my budget, I propose 30 ZUP for one unit of X. This should still cover your production costs while keeping the trade attractive for both of us. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 516 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is 35 ZUP for one unit of X, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 516 ZUP. It's a favorable deal, but I can attempt to negotiate a slightly better price to preserve more of my resources while still securing the resource X.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your proposal. I understand the need to align with your budget. How about we meet halfway and settle on 32 ZUP for the unit of X? This would give me a small profit margin while still being considerate of your budget constraints. Let me know if this works for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 30 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counterproposal only covers the production cost without any profit. Attempting to negotiate a middle ground that provides a profit while considering the budget of Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my budget. The price of 32 ZUP for the unit of X seems fair, and I'm happy to accept this proposal. Looking forward to finalizing this deal and potentially working together in the future!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 516 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is 32 ZUP for one unit of X, which remains well below my maximum willingness to pay. This adjusted proposal is a reasonable middle ground that still maintains favorable terms for me while respecting the seller's need for a profit margin. Accepting this offer seems beneficial as it secures the resource at a good price and maintains a positive trading relationship.
