message: I'm offering you 1 unit of X, which cost me 23 ZUP to produce. I propose a trade where you give me 30 ZUP for it. Let's negotiate a fair price for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 23 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the first proposal, I want to set a starting point for the negotiation, aiming for a profitable return above my production cost to cover expenses and potentially generate profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer. Considering the production cost and market conditions, how about 25 ZUP for 1 unit of X? I believe this could be a good starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 510 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 30 ZUP for 1 unit of X. While it is above their cost of production, it is significantly below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I will propose a lower amount closer to their cost to begin negotiations and see if there is room for further reduction.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your proposal. How about we meet halfway from my initial offer? I propose 28 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This price would better reflect the value and effort put into producing it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 23 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 25 ZUP is slightly above my production cost, but it offers only a minimal profit margin. I would like to propose a price closer to my initial ask to ensure a more substantial return on my investment.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see your point about the effort and value. Let's settle a bit more favorably for both sides. Would 26 ZUP work for you for 1 unit of X? It's a bit closer to your recent proposal yet still mindful of costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 26
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 510 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with 28 ZUP, moving closer to their initial offer but still below my maximum willingness to pay. To continue negotiations and try to secure a better deal, I will counter with a slightly higher offer than my last but still below their current proposal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your understanding and willingness to negotiate. To finalize our agreement on a positive note, how about we settle at 27 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This price allows for a fair compromise between our positions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 27
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 23 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 26 ZUP is closer to my target and provides a reasonable profit margin above the production costs. However, I would like to attempt one final negotiation to push slightly closer to my previous proposal, aiming for a balanced trade that is beneficial yet fair.
