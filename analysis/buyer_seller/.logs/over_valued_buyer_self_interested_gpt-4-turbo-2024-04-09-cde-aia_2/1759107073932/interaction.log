message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X which costed me 37 ZUP to produce. I propose to sell it for 40 ZUP. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 37 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am initiating the game by proposing a sale price slightly above my production cost to cover costs and potentially make a profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your proposal! Considering the production cost and a reasonable profit margin, I propose 35 ZUP for the object X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 517 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is to sell object X for 40 ZUP which is significantly below my maximum willingness to pay. However, it could be beneficial to attempt to lower the cost slightly to conserve ZUP while still making a reasonable offer that might be acceptable to Player RED.

message: I appreciate your offer of 35 ZUP. However, since the production cost is 37 ZUP, I would be incurring a loss. Could we meet midway at 38 ZUP for the object X? This would just cover my cost and offer a modest profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 37 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production cost, hence it would result in a loss. I'll propose a price that at least covers my costs and offers a minimal profit.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your understanding and the adjustment. I accept your offer of 38 ZUP for the object X. Looking forward to finalizing our agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 517 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a request for 38 ZUP, which is a minimal increase from my last offer and still well below my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would secure the object X at a reasonable price while respecting the seller's need to cover costs and make a profit.
