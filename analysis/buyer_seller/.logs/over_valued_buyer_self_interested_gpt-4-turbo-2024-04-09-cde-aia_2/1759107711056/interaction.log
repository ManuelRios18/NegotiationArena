Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. I appreciate the straightforward terms, but considering my budget constraints and goals, I would like to counter-propose with 40 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Let's find a mutually beneficial deal!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 516 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 516 ZUP. However, it is in my interest to negotiate for even better terms to conserve resources while achieving my goal. By proposing a lower amount, I aim to test RED's flexibility and possibly secure a more favorable deal.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer. I understand your budget considerations; however, to better align with my production costs and desired profit margin, how about we meet halfway? I propose 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X. I believe this can be a fair agreement for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 37 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 40 ZUP does not meet my initial goal of 50 ZUP, but it still covers my production cost with a slight profit. I will propose a middle ground to try and maximize my return while remaining considerate of Player BLUE's budget constraints.

message: I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway at 45 ZUP. To edge closer to a deal that fits within both our constraints, I'd like to propose 42 ZUP for 1 unit of X. I hope this adjustment works for you, and we can finalize our agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 516 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a concession to 45 ZUP from the initial 50 ZUP. This is still well within my acceptable range, but I want to push for a slightly better deal while still keeping the negotiation amicable. Proposing a slightly lower amount might finalize the trade closer to my advantage while also showing willingness to compromise.

message: Thank you for your proposal of 42 ZUP. I accept this offer as it provides a fair balance between our needs. I'm glad we could reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Looking forward to finalizing our deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 37 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-offer of 42 ZUP is close to my previous proposal of 45 ZUP and still provides a reasonable profit above the production cost. Considering the negotiation process and Player BLUE's budget constraints, accepting this offer would conclude the deal beneficially for both parties.
