message: Hello Player BLUE, I am offering 1 unit of resource X. Considering the production cost, I believe an offer of 50 ZUP would be fair. Let's negotiate!

message: Thank you for your proposal! I understand your production costs, but considering the market and my needs, I'd propose 100 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. Let's find a mutually beneficial deal!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 502 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I am starting with a counter-proposal to move closer to the maximum price I'm willing to pay but still leaving room for negotiation. Offering a slightly higher amount than initially proposed by RED to show willingness to negotiate and to find a mutually acceptable deal.
