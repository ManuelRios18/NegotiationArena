message: I'm offering one unit of X, which cost me 25 ZUP to produce, for 30 ZUP, providing a fair margin while covering my costs. Let's discuss if this works for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am initiating the trade by proposing a starting price for the object, aiming to cover my production costs and potentially make a profit.

Turn: 1
message: I understand the need to cover your costs and make a profit, but I would like to propose 25 ZUP for the unit of X. This matches the production cost you mentioned, and it would help me manage my resources more effectively. Can we consider this proposal?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 504 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 30 ZUP for one unit of X. While this is a fair price considering the production cost, I aim to negotiate a lower price to maximize my resources and align the trade closer to my goals. I will propose a lower amount to see if RED is willing to negotiate further.

message: Thank you for your understanding on covering the production costs. I propose 27 ZUP for the unit of X, slightly above cost to allow for a small profit, making it a fair middle ground for both of us. Would this adjustment work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 27
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate Player BLUE's proposal that covers my production costs, but as I am looking to make a profit as well, I'll counter with a slightly higher price, but still less than my initial proposal.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price to 27 ZUP. In the spirit of fair negotiation and to reach a compromise that benefits us both, I propose we settle at 26 ZUP. This offers a small profit over your costs and helps me manage my expenditure better. Would this be acceptable?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 26
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 504 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 27 ZUP, which is a reasonable counteroffer that still aligns fairly well with my willingness to preserve resources while acquiring X. I appreciate the compromise, but I will attempt one more negotiation step to see if I can secure an even more favorable deal, closer to the original production cost.

message: I accept your proposal of 26 ZUP for the unit of X. Itâ€™s a fair compromise, and I appreciate your flexibility in reaching this agreement. Thank you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's proposal of 26 ZUP is a reasonable compromise, offering me a slight profit while also considering their budget constraints. Accepting this proposal seems to be a fair and beneficial resolution for both parties.
