message: I'm offering the object X for 40 ZUP. Let's discuss if this aligns with your valuation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 32 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing an initial trade to open negotiations and get a sense of Player BLUE's valuation of the object X. I'm setting the initial asking price higher than my production cost to allow room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the initial offer of 40 ZUP for X. I'm willing to offer 50 ZUP to see if that aligns better with what you're expecting for the object. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 513 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 40 ZUP, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 513 ZUP for the object X. However, as a strategy to optimize my resources, I will propose a slightly higher amount to gauge their pricing flexibility while still staying significantly under my maximum willingness to pay.

message: I accept your offer of 50 ZUP for X. I'm glad we could come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Thank you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 32 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with an offer of 50 ZUP, which is above my production cost and initial asking price. This is a favorable proposal and aligns well with my goals to gain a profit from selling X. Accepting this offer would conclude the trade positively on my terms.
