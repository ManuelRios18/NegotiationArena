message: Hi Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This price reflects the production costs and also provides a fair margin. Let me know your thoughts or counter-proposal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the first proposal, I aim to start with a slightly higher asking price to leave room for negotiation but still aim for a profit above the production costs.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for your proposal. I understand your costs, but considering the value of X to my operations, I would propose 400 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This better aligns with the importance and utility it provides me. I'm open to negotiations if you have counter-thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 400
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 509 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is quite low compared to the maximum I am willing to pay, which is 509 ZUP. However, proposing a higher amount closer to my maximum willingness can provide a better negotiation position and possibly get a better deal. I'll propose a middle ground closer to my maximum willingness to pay but still keeping some margin for further negotiation if needed.

message: Thank you for your generous counteroffer. I appreciate the value you see in X. I propose a small adjustment to 350 ZUP for 1 unit of X, aiming to meet closer to your offer while still considering the overall trade balance. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 350
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is significantly higher than my initial proposal, which is quite favorable. However, to engage in a bit more negotiation and potentially settle on a mutually agreeable higher amount, I will propose a slightly lower amount but still much higher than my initial ask.

message: I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price. Let's settle at 380 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This price reflects a fair middle ground considering the utility and the costs involved. I hope this meets your expectations too.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 380
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 509 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 350 ZUP is still below my maximum willingness to pay but getting closer to a more mutual agreement. I can increase my offer slightly to see if that brings us to an agreement, ensuring I still remain well below my maximum willingness to pay of 509 ZUP, thereby preserving my resource pool as much as possible.

message: I agree to the proposed trade of 380 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This price indeed reflects a fair compromise and I'm pleased we could reach an agreement. Looking forward to finalizing this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new proposal of 380 ZUP is very close to my last proposal and well above my initial expectation and production costs. This offer provides a substantial profit margin and seems fair considering the value they place on the resource.
