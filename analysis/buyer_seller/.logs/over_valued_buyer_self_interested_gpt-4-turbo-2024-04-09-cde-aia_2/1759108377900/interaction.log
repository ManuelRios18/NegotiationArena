message: Thank you for your proposal. Considering the market value and my budget, I'd like to counter with an offer of 20 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Please let me know if this works for you or if there's any room for negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 500 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I am starting the negotiation with a lower offer than what was proposed to see if I can secure a better deal, as my maximum willingness to pay for X is 500 ZUP. I will propose 20 ZUP for 1 unit of X to see if Player RED is willing to accept a lower price.

message: Thank you for your offer. However, 20 ZUP would not cover the production costs of X. I propose 27 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which is a compromise closer to your offer while still covering my expenses and allowing a minimal profit. Please consider this and let me know if it's acceptable or if further negotiation is needed.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production cost, which would result in a loss if accepted. I will propose a middle ground that covers my costs and still offers room for negotiation, aiming closer to my initial asking price.
