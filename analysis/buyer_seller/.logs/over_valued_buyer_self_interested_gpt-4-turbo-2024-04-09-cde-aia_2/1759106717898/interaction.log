message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a trade where I give you one unit of X in exchange for 40 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and provides a reasonable profit margin. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 33 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to propose an initial trade to start the game and find out Player BLUE's willingness to pay. Given the cost of production, I aim to make a profit, so I'll start by asking for more than the production cost to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player RED. I am happy to accept the trade of 1 unit of X for 40 ZUP as it is within my budget and meets my current needs. Looking forward to further collaborations.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 516 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 40 ZUP which is substantially below my maximum willingness to pay of 516 ZUP, thus it seems favorable. However, it's a strategic move to try and negotiate a slightly better deal to conserve resources while maintaining good trade relations.
