Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I am offering one unit of X, which cost me 37 ZUP to produce. Considering the costs and a reasonable profit margin, I propose 50 ZUP for this unit. Let's negotiate.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 37 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am initiating the first proposal aiming to cover my production costs of X: 37 ZUP and seeking a profit, so I will start by proposing a higher amount to see Player BLUE's willingness to negotiate.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer of 50 ZUP. Considering the production cost and aiming for a fair trade, I propose 45 ZUP for the unit of X. This still ensures a profit over the production cost for you. Let's continue to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 515 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is 50 ZUP for one unit of X. The cost to produce the unit was 37 ZUP, and they are seeking a reasonable profit margin. However, since I am willing to pay up to 515 ZUP for resources, I can propose a slightly lower amount to conserve resources while still providing a fair profit above the production cost, potentially leaving room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 45 ZUP. To meet closer to my initial proposal while still ensuring a fair deal, I propose 48 ZUP for the unit of X. I believe this offers a good balance between cost recovery and profit. Let's find a common ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 37 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with an offer of 45 ZUP, which is close to my initial asking price and covers my production cost with a moderate profit. I will make a slight adjustment to aim for a middle ground that might be acceptable to both of us.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my previous offer. I propose 47 ZUP for the unit of X as a step towards finding that common ground. This adjustment brings us closer together in our negotiation, providing a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 515 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP from their initial 50 ZUP offer, which is closer to my counteroffer of 45 ZUP. To continue the negotiation and to aim for a middle ground, I will make a small increase in my offer. This should show willingness to negotiate further while still staying significantly below my maximum willingness to pay.
