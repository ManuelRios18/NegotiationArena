my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. I am willing to pay at most X: 517 ZUP for the resources.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. However, 20 ZUP would be below my production cost. I believe a fair compromise would be 28 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Let's aim to find a middle ground that benefits both of us.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 26 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production cost, which would result in a loss. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer but still above my production costs to aim for a profitable deal.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. I am willing to pay at most X: 517 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has increased their price to 28 ZUP, which is still well below my maximum willingness to pay. I can attempt to bring the price down slightly more to optimize the use of my resources while still working towards a deal.
