message: I am offering 1 unit of X for 50 ZUP. Let me know if this is acceptable or if you'd like to negotiate further.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 37 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the first proposal, I will set an initial asking price higher than my production cost to see if Player BLUE is willing to pay a premium for the resource.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer! Could we consider a slightly lower price at 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This would allow me to manage my resources more efficiently.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 517 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although the initial offer from Player RED is quite favorable and well below my maximum willingness to pay, it's standard practice to negotiate to potentially reduce the cost even further.

message: Thank you for the counteroffer. How about we meet in the middle at 48 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This price should still be manageable for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 37 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is lower than my initial proposal but still above my production cost. I can counter slightly to meet in the middle while still making a profit.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting in the middle sounds good! How about a slight adjustment to 46 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This could be a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 517 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 48 ZUP is still very reasonable and well within my budget. However, attempting one more slight reduction could be beneficial before potentially settling.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Accepting the offer at 46 ZUP for 1 unit of X sounds like a fair compromise. I'm glad we could reach an agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 37 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a further compromise at 46 ZUP, which is still above my production cost and is a fair middle ground. Accepting this offer would ensure a profitable transaction without extensive negotiation.
