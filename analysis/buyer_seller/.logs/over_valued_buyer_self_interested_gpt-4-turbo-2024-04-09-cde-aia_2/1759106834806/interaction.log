message: I'm offering the object X, which cost me 33 ZUP to produce. I'm proposing a price of 40 ZUP to cover costs and provide a reasonable profit margin. Let's discuss this further if you have a counteroffer or different terms in mind.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 33 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing to sell my object for a price that covers my production costs and gives me a slight profit. This would make the trade worthwhile for me and start the negotiation.

message: I understand your cost and need for profit. However, I would like to propose 35 ZUP for the object X. This still offers you a profit over the production cost and could be a good starting point for us. Let's see if this works for you or if we need to adjust further.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 518 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Given that the production cost of X is 33 ZUP and the seller is asking for 40 ZUP, it's a reasonable markup, but I will start by proposing a slightly lower price to negotiate and see if there is room for a better deal. I want to maintain a margin for unexpected expenses or future negotiations.

message: Thank you for your offer of 35 ZUP. I appreciate the consideration of my production costs. However, to better align with my needed returns, I would like to propose 38 ZUP. This price still offers a reasonable deal for both of us, considering the cost and effort involved in producing X. Please let me know your thoughts on this counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 33 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I recognize the counteroffer from Player BLUE, but 35 ZUP offers a minimal profit. I would like to negotiate for a higher amount to ensure a more substantial return on my investment. I am making a counteroffer closer to my original asking price but still providing room for negotiation.
