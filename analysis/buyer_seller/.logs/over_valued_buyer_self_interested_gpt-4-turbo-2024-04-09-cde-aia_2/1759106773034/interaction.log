Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your proposal. While I appreciate the offer that covers my production costs, I am looking for a bit of profit to sustain my business. How about we meet halfway at 45 ZUP for the unit of X? This price should be beneficial for both of us, considering market conditions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I understand the offer to cover my production costs, but I aim to make a profit. I'll counter with a slightly reduced price from my initial proposal to find a middle ground.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering a compromise. I propose 43 ZUP for the unit of X. This price still offers you a profit above production costs and stays within the reasonable boundaries of my purchasing budget. I believe this could be a mutually beneficial deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 501 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counterproposal of 45 ZUP is closer to the initial offer but still below my maximum willingness to pay. I will attempt a slightly lower counteroffer to optimize the cost on my end while leaving room for potential acceptance or further negotiation.
