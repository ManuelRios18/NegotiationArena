message: I'm offering 1 unit of X for 30 ZUP. This price includes my production costs and a reasonable profit margin. Let's discuss if this works for you or if you have a counter-proposal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 24 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As this is the first proposal, I want to set a starting price that would cover my production costs and potentially give a small profit. I will start by proposing a trade that asks for slightly more than my cost to see the willingness and negotiation range of Player BLUE.

message: I appreciate your initial offer of 30 ZUP for 1 unit of X. To align the trade better with my budgeting goals, I would like to counter-propose 25 ZUP for the same. Let's see if this adjusted proposal works for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 505 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 30 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Since I am willing to pay up to 505 ZUP, this offer is well within my budget. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if I can optimize the trade further.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counter-offer. To meet halfway and considering the production costs, I propose 28 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This should offer a fair balance between your budget and my cost recovery needs. How does this sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 24 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is slightly above my production cost, which is good, but it's lower than my initial asking price. I want to try to negotiate a middle ground that is closer to my initial proposal yet still reasonable enough to potentially close the deal.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your proposal of 28 ZUP for 1 unit of X sounds fair and reasonable. It fits well within my budget constraints, and I'm happy to accept this offer. Let's proceed with this deal. Thank you for the negotiation!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 505 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-offer from Player RED is 28 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which is still significantly below my maximum willingness to pay. It's a reasonable middle ground between my initial counter-offer and their starting price. Accepting this offer aligns with my goals and ensures a fair deal for both parties.
