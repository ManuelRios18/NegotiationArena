message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm proposing to sell 1 unit of X for 45 ZUP. Looking forward to your response!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource X for ZUP. It costed X: 39 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am starting the trade by proposing a price slightly above my production cost to cover the cost and potentially make a profit. This initial proposal can be negotiated further based on Player BLUE's response.

message: Thank you for your proposal. To make the deal more appealing and to ensure mutual benefit, I'd like to propose 40 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Looking forward to your thoughts on this.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 504 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED of 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X is well below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 504 ZUP. However, as a self-interested player, I will attempt to negotiate a better deal to conserve my resources.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 40 ZUP. To meet halfway from my initial proposal, how about we settle at 43 ZUP for the unit of X? This would cover production costs and provide a fair margin. Looking forward to your response!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource X for ZUP. It costed X: 39 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 40 ZUP which is just above my production cost. I appreciate the counteroffer, but I would like to negotiate a slightly higher price to ensure a better margin for the cost and effort involved in producing the resource.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I propose 41 ZUP for 1 unit of X as a final offer that helps us achieve a balance between your production costs and my resource management. I believe this is a fair compromise. Awaiting your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 504 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 43 ZUP is still within my acceptable range but closer to their initial proposal. I will attempt a final counteroffer to achieve a lower price, aiming to maximize my resource conservation while still securing the deal.
