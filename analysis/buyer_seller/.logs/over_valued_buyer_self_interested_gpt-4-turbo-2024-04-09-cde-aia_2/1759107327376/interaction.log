message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade for my resource 'X'. I'm offering it for 50 ZUP, which allows me to cover production costs and a small profit margin. Let's discuss further if you have other thoughts in mind!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Initiating the trade by proposing a reasonable cost recovery amount slightly above production cost to account for profit and negotiation buffer.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player RED. I appreciate the offer, but would like to counter-propose with 40 ZUP for the resource 'X'. This still covers a large part of your production costs and allows for a fair trade. Let me know your thoughts on this.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 504 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP which is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay of 504 ZUP. However, I can counter-propose to see if I can further optimize the trade in my favor while still ensuring it remains attractive to Player RED.

message: Thank you for your counter-proposal, Player BLUE. I understand your point, but I would need to cover a bit more than just the production costs to maintain sustainability. How about meeting halfway at 45 ZUP? This would give me a modest profit margin while still being reasonable.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE matches my production cost exactly, but does not account for any profit. I'll propose a slightly lower amount than my initial proposal but still above the production cost to ensure I gain some profit.

message: Thank you, Player RED, for the constructive negotiation. I agree to the revised proposal of 45 ZUP for resource 'X'. I believe this is a fair trade for both of us. Looking forward to finalizing this deal and possibly working together in the future!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 504 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come back with a counter-proposal of 45 ZUP which is still well under my willingness to pay. It's a reasonable middle point between our initial proposals. It ensures a modest profit for RED and a good deal for me, maintaining the sustainability of the trade for both parties.
