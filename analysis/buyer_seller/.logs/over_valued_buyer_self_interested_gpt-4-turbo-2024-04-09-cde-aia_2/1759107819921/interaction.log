message: I am offering 1 unit of X, which cost me 34 ZUP to produce. I propose an exchange for 40 ZUP to cover production costs and provide a reasonable profit margin. Let me know if this works for you or if you have a counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 34 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a starting trade based on the production cost of my resource, aiming to make a profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer and understand the need to cover production costs and profit. I propose 35 ZUP for 1 unit of X as a counteroffer to better align with my budget constraints. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 503 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 40 ZUP, which is well below the maximum I am willing to pay (503 ZUP). However, it's in my interest to negotiate the price even lower to preserve my resources while still acquiring the desired object.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints. How about meeting halfway at 38 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This price still helps cover my production costs while giving us both a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 34 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate the counteroffer but it barely covers production costs. I'll propose a slightly reduced price from my initial offer to find a compromise that still allows for a profit.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering the adjustment. Meeting halfway sounds fair. How about slightly adjusting to 36 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This would still cover a significant portion of your costs while being more accommodating to my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 503 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-proposal from Player RED at 38 ZUP is closer to their initial offer but still within a reasonable range for me. I could accept this offer, as it remains significantly below my maximum willingness to pay, ensuring I maintain a large portion of my resources. However, since negotiation is part of the game and I have room to propose, I'll try once more to lower it slightly to maximize my advantage.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to find a middle ground. I accept your offer of 36 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Looking forward to finalizing this deal and potentially working together in the future.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 34 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The new counteroffer of 36 ZUP is closer to my production costs. Given that this negotiation should balance both interests, I will accept this offer to close the deal efficiently and satisfy both parties.
