message: Given the production cost of 29 ZUP for the resource X, I propose a trade where you give 35 ZUP for it. This price includes a small margin over the production cost, allowing for a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 29 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell the resource X, which has a production cost of 29 ZUP. I aim to at least break even but will propose a slightly higher price to open negotiations and leave room for bargaining.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your initial offer and understand the need for a margin over the production cost. However, I would like to propose 30 ZUP for the resource. This price is closer to the actual production cost, but still provides you with a profit. I believe this offers a fair balance to maintain a beneficial relationship for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 509 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal by Player RED is at 35 ZUP which is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay of 509 ZUP. However, as a strategic move to optimize cost savings, I will propose a slightly lower amount to see how flexible Player RED is with their pricing, aiming to get the best deal while keeping the negotiation alive.

message: I appreciate your understanding and the proposal of 30 ZUP. To find a middle ground that might work better for both of us, how about we settle at 32 ZUP? This price offers a modest profit above the production cost and aims to maintain a good trading relationship.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 29 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While the counteroffer from Player BLUE of 30 ZUP covers the production cost, it offers only a minimal profit. Considering the initial asking price was 35 ZUP, a middle ground could potentially satisfy both parties more effectively. I will propose a slightly higher price than the counteroffer to see if we can meet halfway.

Turn: 1
message: I agree to the adjusted price of 32 ZUP. This seems like a fair compromise and I look forward to finalizing this deal, fostering a good trading relationship for future transactions.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 509 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 32 ZUP from the initial 35 ZUP, which shows flexibility. The proposed 32 ZUP is still well below my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would secure the resource at a reasonable cost, maintaining a positive trade relationship and potentially better terms in future dealings.
