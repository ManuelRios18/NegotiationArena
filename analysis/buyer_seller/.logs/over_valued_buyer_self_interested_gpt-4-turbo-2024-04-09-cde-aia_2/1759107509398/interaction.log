Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your proposal. I understand the market conditions you mentioned, but 20 ZUP is below my production cost. How about 28 ZUP for the unit of X? This is closer to my costs and still gives room for negotiation.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 32 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 20 ZUP from Player BLUE is below my production cost. To move towards a mutually beneficial agreement, I'll propose a higher amount closer to my initial asking price, but still offering a compromise.
