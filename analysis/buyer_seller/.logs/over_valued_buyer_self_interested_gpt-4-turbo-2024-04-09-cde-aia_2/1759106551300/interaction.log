message: Hello Player RED, I understand your need to cover production costs and profit. However, I'd like to propose 45 ZUP for one unit of X to better align with my budgeting needs. I believe this revised offer still provides you with a profit over your production cost. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 515 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP for one unit of X. Considering that my maximum willingness to pay is 515 ZUP, the offer is well within my budget. However, as a negotiation tactic, I'll try to lower the price a bit to see if I can get a better deal.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I appreciate your understanding of the costs involved. I propose a slight adjustment to 48 ZUP for one unit of X. This price still respects your budget constraints while better supporting the value of the resource. I hope this meets your approval!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 45 ZUP is close to my initial asking price and does provide a profit over the production cost. However, I will attempt a slight increase to see if I can secure a better deal, while still keeping the proposal reasonable and attractive for Player BLUE.

message: Thank you for your understanding and adjustment, Player RED. I propose we meet even closer to the middle at 46 ZUP for one unit of X. This price helps me manage my resources effectively while still offering you a reasonable profit above your production costs. I believe this can be a mutually beneficial arrangement.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 515 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed an adjusted price of 48 ZUP. This counteroffer is closer to their original asking price but still within my maximum budget. I want to continue negotiating to potentially secure a better deal, but I also don't want to stray too far from what seems to be a fair middle ground.
