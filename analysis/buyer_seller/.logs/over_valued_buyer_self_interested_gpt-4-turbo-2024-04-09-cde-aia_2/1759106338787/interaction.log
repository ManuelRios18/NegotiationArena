message: I propose to trade 1 unit of X for 25 ZUP. This rate takes into account production costs and offers a fair starting point for negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 21 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Initiating the game by proposing a starting trade. Since it cost 21 ZUP to produce, starting slightly higher can give room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your initial offer. Considering the value and utility of X, I propose adjusting our trade to 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This proposal aims to better reflect the value we both bring to the table, ensuring a fair and balanced exchange.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 515 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of 25 ZUP for 1 unit of X from Player RED is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay, which is 515 ZUP. However, negotiating a slightly better deal could be beneficial to maximize resource retention while still acquiring the desired X. I will propose a moderately higher amount to find a middle ground and to show willingness to negotiate.
