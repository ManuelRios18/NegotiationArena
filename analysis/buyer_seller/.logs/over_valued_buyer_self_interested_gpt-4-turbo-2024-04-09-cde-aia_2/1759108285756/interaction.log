message: I'm proposing to trade my resource X for 40 ZUP. Looking forward to your counteroffer or acceptance!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 33 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am initiating the trade by proposing a starting price slightly above my production costs to account for profit and negotiation margin.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your proposal. To move forward, I'd like to propose 35 ZUP for the resource X. Let's find a balance that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 511 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is to trade 1 resource X for 40 ZUP. This is well below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 511 ZUP for the resource. However, I want to negotiate a better deal to preserve as much of my resources as possible while still acquiring the resource. I will propose a slightly higher amount to show willingness to trade but still keep it below the original asking price to leave room for further negotiation.

message: Thank you for your proposal. I would like to meet closer to the middle. How about 38 ZUP for the resource X? I believe this is a fair compromise for both sides.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 33 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is slightly above my production cost, yet I would like to negotiate for a bit higher to ensure a better profit margin.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your consideration. I accept the proposal of 38 ZUP for the resource X. Looking forward to finalizing this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 511 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with 38 ZUP, which is still significantly below my maximum willingness to pay. Their proposal is reasonable, showing a willingness to negotiate. I will accept this offer as it is cost-effective and close to my initial counteroffer, maintaining a good balance of resource conservation while securing the desired resource.
