newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your proposal. I understand your costs, but would like to explore if we can settle at a slightly lower price. How about 35 ZUP for one unit of X? Does this work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 503 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The opening offer from Player RED is 40 ZUP for one unit of resource X, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay. It's a reasonable price, but as part of negotiation strategy, I'll propose a slightly lower price to see if there is room for a better deal.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your consideration of the costs. Would you be able to meet at a middle ground of 38 ZUP for one unit of X? This price would better reflect the value and effort put into producing the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 34 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my initial asking price but still above my production costs, making it a viable option. However, I will attempt to negotiate a slightly higher price to maximize profit while remaining fair.

message: I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway at 38 ZUP for one unit of X. This seems like a fair compromise, and I'm happy to accept this offer. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 503 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 38 ZUP, suggesting a compromise. This is still well below my maximum willingness to pay and seems like a reasonable middle ground that reflects fair value for both sides. Accepting this offer would secure a good deal for me without exhausting negotiation resources.
