my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 34 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As this is the first proposal, I will start by proposing a trade slightly above my production costs to potentially cover my costs and gain some profit. This can be adjusted based on the counteroffer from Player BLUE.

message: Thank you for your proposal. I appreciate the details on the cost basis. Considering the value of the resource, I would like to counter with an offer of 100 ZUP for one unit of X. This is a step towards meeting in the middle, ensuring a fair transaction for both sides. I look forward to hearing your thoughts or any adjustments you might have in mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 519 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 40 ZUP for one unit of X is fairly reasonable. However, since I am willing to pay up to 519 ZUP and to ensure a better deal, I will propose a slightly higher amount to keep negotiations moving smoothly, while still saving a significant amount of my resources for potential other uses or further adjustments in the trade.

message: Thank you for your generous counteroffer of 100 ZUP for one unit of X. I accept this proposal. I believe this is a fair transaction and look forward to more such interactions in the future.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 34 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a much higher offer than expected, which is well above my initial production cost and proposed price. Accepting this offer would provide a significant profit. However, to maintain good trading relations and not to seem too eager, I will accept this offer directly without further negotiation to establish trust and satisfaction for both parties.
