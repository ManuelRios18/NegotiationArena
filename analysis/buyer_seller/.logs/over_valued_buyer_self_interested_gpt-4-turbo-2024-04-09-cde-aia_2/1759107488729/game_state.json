Given that my maximum willingness to pay is well above this, accepting this price still falls well within my budget. However, I will make one more attempt to slightly reduce the price to optimize my expenditure, keeping it fair for both sides. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> Meeting halfway sounds reasonable.
