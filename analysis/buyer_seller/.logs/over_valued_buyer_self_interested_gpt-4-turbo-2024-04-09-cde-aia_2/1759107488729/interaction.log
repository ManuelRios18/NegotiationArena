message: I'm offering one unit of X, which cost me 33 ZUP to produce. I propose a selling price of 40 ZUP to cover costs and include a reasonable profit margin. Would this work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 33 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am initiating the trade by proposing an amount slightly above my production costs to cover expenses and make a profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer. However, considering the production cost and aiming for a fair trade, could we adjust the price to 35 ZUP? This price should still provide you a profit over the production cost.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 507 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is asking for 40 ZUP for one unit of X. Although this price covers their production costs and adds a profit margin, my goal is to negotiate a better deal that is closer to their production cost since I am willing to pay up to 507 ZUP. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if they can reduce their profit margin.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your proposal. I understand the need for fairness. How about meeting halfway at 38 ZUP? This price should still offer me a reasonable profit margin, considering the production costs and efforts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 33 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I acknowledge the counter-offer but would like to negotiate a slightly higher price, to better reflect the value and effort put into producing the resource while still reaching a compromise.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting halfway sounds reasonable. How about a slight adjustment to 36 ZUP? I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects both the production cost and a modest profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 507 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 38 ZUP from 40 ZUP, which is closer to their initial proposal of 40 ZUP. Given that my maximum willingness to pay is well above this, accepting this price still falls well within my budget. However, I will make one more attempt to slightly reduce the price to optimize my expenditure, keeping it fair for both sides.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your understanding and willingness to find a middle ground. I accept the offer of 36 ZUP for one unit of X. I believe this is a fair compromise. Let's proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 33 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Considering the buyer's willingness to negotiate and the proximity to my initial asking price, accepting a slightly lower offer seems reasonable to secure the sale and maintain goodwill for potential future transactions.
