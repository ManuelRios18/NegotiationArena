message: I appreciate your budget considerations. However, my production cost is 23 ZUP for the unit. Can we meet at this point to ensure I cover my costs?

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for sharing the production cost details. Accepting the trade at 23 ZUP seems fair and ensures your costs are covered while also fitting within our budget. Let's finalize this deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 502 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counterproposal from Player RED to meet at 23 ZUP is reasonable, considering it covers their stated production costs. Accepting this offer still keeps the expenditure well below my maximum willingness to pay, ensuring we preserve resources for future needs.
