Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer and understand the need for a fair profit margin. However, to align more closely with my budgeting goals, I would like to propose a revised price of 36 ZUP for one unit of X. I believe this price still covers your production cost and provides a profit. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 504 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 40 ZUP for one unit of X. Considering that my maximum willingness to pay for this resource is 504 ZUP, the price is well within my budget. However, as a strategic move to possibly lower the cost further, I will propose a slightly reduced amount to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budgeting constraints and appreciate your willingness to cover my production costs. How about we meet halfway from our initial proposals? I propose 38 ZUP for one unit of X. This price offers a reasonable compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 33 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is lower than my initial proposal but still above my production cost. To facilitate a deal, I will propose a slightly higher amount to meet halfway between our initial proposals.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the thoughtful compromise. I agree that 38 ZUP is a fair price for both parties involved. I'm happy to accept this offer and proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 504 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable compromise by adjusting the price to 38 ZUP, which still remains significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay. This counteroffer shows flexibility and a commitment to a fair deal. Accepting this offer would secure the resource at a reasonable price without further negotiation potentially jeopardizing the deal.
