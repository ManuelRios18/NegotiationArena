message: I'm offering one unit of X, which cost me 25 ZUP to produce. I'm proposing a selling price of 30 ZUP to cover the production cost and a small margin. Let me know your thoughts or counter-offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It cost X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the first proposal, I am setting a price slightly higher than my production cost to start the negotiation and cover potential bargaining.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer and understand the production costs involved. However, considering the market and my needs, I'd like to propose a counter-offer of 25 ZUP for one unit of X. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 508 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 30 ZUP for one unit of X, which is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay (508 ZUP). However, as a strategic move to secure a better deal, I should propose a lower price to see if there's room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counter-offer. I understand your position, but to make this viable for me, I'd need to cover a bit more than just the production cost. How about we settle at 28 ZUP? This would still give you a fair price below my initial ask.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It cost X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-offer matches my production cost, leaving no profit. I'll propose a compromise closer to my initial asking price to try and secure a small profit margin.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I think 28 ZUP is a fair compromise. I accept this offer. Let's finalize the deal at this price. Thank you for the negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 508 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer from Player RED is 28 ZUP, which is closer to the initial proposal but still below my maximum willingness to pay. I can afford to accept this offer as it is reasonable and allows me to secure the resource while maintaining a significant amount of ZUP for future needs.
