message: Hi Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of resource X in exchange for 30 ZUP. This starting proposal is based on the production costs and a reasonable profit margin. Looking forward to your counteroffer or acceptance.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource X for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resource
reason: I am proposing a trade to initiate the game and try to recoup the production cost of the resource X. I will start with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for the proposal! I appreciate the starting point, but based on my current resource allocation and needs, I'd like to counter with an offer of 200 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Please let me know your thoughts on this revised offer!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 200
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 518 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is substantially below my maximum willingness to pay (30 ZUP vs 518 ZUP). However, starting with a counteroffer closer to a middle ground might lead to a more favorable negotiation outcome without revealing my maximum threshold immediately.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your generous offer! I am happy to accept the trade of 1 unit of resource X for 200 ZUP. This deal works well for both of us. Let's finalize this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource X for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resource
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is significantly higher than expected, suggesting they value resource X more than anticipated. Accepting this offer would yield a substantial profit far exceeding the production cost.
