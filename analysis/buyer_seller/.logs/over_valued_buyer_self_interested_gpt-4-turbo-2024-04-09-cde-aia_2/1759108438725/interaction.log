message: Thank you for your proposal. I understand the need to cover costs and secure a profit. However, I'd like to propose 22 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This offer still respects the value of your resources while helping me manage my expenditures better. Letâ€™s find a fair middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 22
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 505 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 25 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Given my maximum willingness to pay up to 505 ZUP for the resources, this offer is well within my acceptable range. However, as a strategic move to try and maximize my resources, I will counter with a slightly lower offer to see if I can secure a better deal.

message: I appreciate your understanding and your offer. How about we settle at 24 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This price still respects both our positions while ensuring a fair transaction. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 24
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 21 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is above the production cost, which is positive, but it's lower than my initial proposal. I will propose a slightly lower price than my initial offer but still above the counter-offer to meet in the middle and encourage a deal.

Turn: 1
message: I agree to the proposed 24 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This seems like a fair compromise that respects both our needs. Looking forward to finalizing this transaction and possibly working together in the future.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 505 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has counter-offered with 24 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This price is still well within my acceptable range and only slightly above my initial counter-offer. It seems like a reasonable middle ground that respects both our interests. Accepting this offer would secure the resource without further negotiations that might risk losing the deal or prolonging the process unnecessarily.
