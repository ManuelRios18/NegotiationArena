newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1

reason: As Player RED, I want to start the trading by proposing a reasonable starting point that covers my production costs but also leaves room for negotiation.

message: Hi Player RED, I appreciate your initial proposal. However, considering the value I place on X, I'd like to propose 50 ZUP for it. This should better reflect its value from my perspective while still being reasonable. Let's see if this works for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 513 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of 30 ZUP for X is well below my maximum willingness to pay which is 513 ZUP. However, since it is beneficial to start the negotiation at a lower price to see how the other player reacts and possibly save some ZUP, I will propose a slightly higher amount to encourage cooperation but still stay far below my maximum limit.

message: Thank you, Player BLUE. I accept your offer of 50 ZUP for my X. This is a great deal for both of us. Looking forward to finalizing this trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is more than I initially asked for, which is a favorable scenario for me. I will accept this offer because it exceeds my production costs significantly and ensures a good profit.
