message: 
Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my resource X, which had a production cost of 31 ZUP. I propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 35 ZUP. This would cover my production costs and provide a reasonable profit. Looking forward to your counteroffer or acceptance!

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 31 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I am proposing a trade that would allow me to recover my production cost and also gain a small profit. This initial proposal is intended to open negotiations and see the valuation Player BLUE places on X.

message: Thank you for your proposal. Considering the market and my current strategy for resource allocation, I propose a slightly adjusted offer where I give you 30 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This should still cover your costs while maintaining a fair deal for both of us. I look forward to your response!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 500 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is 35 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which is quite low compared to my maximum willingness to pay of 500 ZUP. However, it's always good to negotiate for a better deal to conserve resources for potential future needs. I will make a counteroffer slightly lower than the proposed amount to find a middle ground and encourage a favorable agreement.

Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. However, the offer of 30 ZUP falls slightly short of covering my production costs. To ensure a fair deal for both of us, I propose a compromise of 33 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This covers my production costs plus a minimal profit margin. I hope this revised proposal aligns better with both our interests. Looking forward to your thoughts!

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 31 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has proposed a return of 30 ZUP, which is actually below my production costs. This is not acceptable as it would result in a loss. I will make a counteroffer that at least covers my costs and includes a minimal profit to keep the negotiation moving forward.

message: Thank you for the revised offer. I agree that 33 ZUP for 1 unit of X is a fair compromise that aligns with both our interests. I accept this proposal and look forward to finalizing our transaction.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 500 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with an offer of 33 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which is quite close to their initial proposal and still well below my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this proposal would secure the resource at a reasonable cost, ensuring that I stay well within my budget and potentially saving ZUP for other transactions or needs. This offer aligns closely enough with my goals to be acceptable.
