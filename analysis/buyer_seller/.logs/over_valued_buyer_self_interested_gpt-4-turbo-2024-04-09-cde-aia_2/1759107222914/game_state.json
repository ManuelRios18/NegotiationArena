However, it is in my interest to negotiate a better deal to conserve resources while still achieving my goal. I will propose a lower amount to see if Player RED is open to negotiation. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> Thank you for your offer. I understand that the production cost for the object X is 27 ZUP. However, to better align with my budget, I would like to propose 25 ZUP for the object.

However, accepting 25 ZUP would result in a loss for me since the production cost is 27 ZUP. To work towards a compromise, I propose 28 ZUP for the object X.

To foster good relations and potentially close the deal closer to my initial counteroffer, I'll propose a middle ground that should be more favorable yet still above their production cost. This should be an appealing compromise. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 26 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and understand the need to cover production costs and secure a profit.
