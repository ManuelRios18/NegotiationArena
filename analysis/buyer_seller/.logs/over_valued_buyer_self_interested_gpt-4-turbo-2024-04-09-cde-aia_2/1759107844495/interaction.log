message: Hi Player BLUE, I'm offering one of my resources, X, for 45 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and includes a reasonable margin. Let's discuss if this works for you or if you have a counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 38 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am initiating the trade by proposing a starting price that covers my production costs plus a modest profit. This will start negotiations and help gauge the buyer's willingness to pay.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. Considering the market conditions and my budget constraints, I'd like to counter propose 40 ZUP for the resource X. Let's see if this adjustment works for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 519 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 45 ZUP for one unit of X, which is significantly below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a strategic move, I will propose a slightly lower price to see if there is room for negotiation and to potentially save resources while still comfortably staying within my budget.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'd like to meet halfway between our initial proposals. How about 43 ZUP for the resource X? This should balance both our cost considerations and the value of the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 38 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is slightly above my production cost, but I aim for a higher return. I will propose a midpoint between our initial offers to find a mutually agreeable price.

message: Thank you for the compromise, Player RED. I accept the offer of 43 ZUP for the resource X. I believe this price fairly reflects the value and supports both our needs effectively.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 519 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a new price of 43 ZUP, which is a compromise between our initial offers. This price is still well below my maximum willingness to pay and seems fair considering the mutual benefit and the need to maintain a good trading relationship. Accepting this offer will secure the resource I need without exhausting my resources.
