Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the proposal. I understand the need to cover production costs and profit, but I would like to propose a slightly lower amount of 25 ZUP for the object X. This would help me manage my resources better while still ensuring you a profit. Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 509 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED for X at 30 ZUP is well below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 509 ZUP. However, it is in my interest to negotiate for an even lower price to conserve my resources for potential future needs or other purchases.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your proposal. I understand the need to manage your resources. However, selling at 25 ZUP would only cover my production costs without any profit. Could we meet in the middle at 28 ZUP? This would help me secure a minimal profit while still being considerate of your budget constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to cover my production costs completely, and a trade at 25 ZUP would only allow me to break even without any profit. Proposing a middle ground to try and secure some profit while considering the concerns of Player BLUE.

message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle at 28 ZUP. I agree to this price, and I'm ready to finalize the trade. Thank you for the negotiation, and I look forward to possibly working together again in the future.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 509 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with 28 ZUP which is still well below my maximum willingness to pay. It is a reasonable counteroffer, closer to their initial proposal but still lower than that. I could accept this to secure the resource at a good price and save my remaining proposals for potential adjustments or future negotiations.
