newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1

reason: I need to recover at least the production cost of 37 ZUP to make a profit. Starting the trade proposal slightly higher to leave room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'd like to propose a revised trade of 30 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This adjustment better aligns with my budget considerations while still providing you with a solid return, considering market conditions and demand. Looking forward to your response!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 508 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 40 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This price is well below my maximum willingness to pay (508 ZUP). However, I will attempt to propose a slightly lower price to optimize my expenditure while maintaining a reasonable offer.

message: Thank you for your proposal. I understand your budget constraints, however, 30 ZUP is below my production cost. I propose a middle ground of 35 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This should help cover my costs while considering your budget. Let's work together to finalize this deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 37 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-offer of 30 ZUP is below my production cost, which would result in a loss. I need to propose a compromise that is closer to my original asking price but still gives some ground to facilitate a deal.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree to the proposed price of 35 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This strikes a fair balance and I'm happy to finalize the deal at this rate. Looking forward to future cooperation!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 508 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with 35 ZUP, which remains well below my maximum willingness to pay. This price is a reasonable middle ground, close to the initial proposal, and still offers a good deal considering the budget and goals. Accepting this would ensure securing the resource without further negotiation risks and still save a significant amount of ZUP.
