message: Hello, I'm offering one unit of X, which cost me 21 ZUP to produce. I propose a trade where you give me 25 ZUP for this unit. Let me know what you think!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 21 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the opening proposal, I aim to set a starting price that allows for negotiation but also seeks to recover the production costs of the resource. I propose a price slightly above the production cost to allow for negotiation flexibility.

message: Hello! Thank you for your proposal. I understand your costs but would like to propose 22 ZUP for the unit of X. Let's see if we can agree on this. What are your thoughts?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 22
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 507 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is to trade 1 unit of X for 25 ZUP. This is well below my maximum willingness to pay (507 ZUP), and RED's cost to produce the unit is 21 ZUP, which suggests a reasonable markup. However, I will propose a slightly lower price to better align with market negotiation tactics and see if there is room for a better deal.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate the understanding of my costs. However, to cover the production cost and ensure a reasonable margin, I'd like to propose 24 ZUP for the unit of X. Let's work towards a middle ground that benefits both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 24
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 21 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is slightly above my production cost, but it does not account for a reasonable profit margin. I want to counter-propose with a slightly reduced amount from my initial proposal, yet maintaining a margin above the production cost to ensure some profit.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet a bit closer from my last offer? I propose 23 ZUP for the unit of X. Does this sound reasonable to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 23
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 507 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a proposal of 24 ZUP, which is closer to their initial asking price. This is still significantly below my maximum willingness to pay. I will propose a slightly higher amount from my last proposal, which is still below their latest ask but also shows willingness to negotiate further.

Turn: 0
message: I believe this is a fair compromise. I accept the offer of 23 ZUP for the unit of X. Thank you for negotiating and reaching a reasonable agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 21 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's proposal is closer to a middle ground and offers a marginal profit over the production cost. Accepting this proposal allows for a quick conclusion of the trade while ensuring a profit, albeit smaller than initially desired. This approach can maintain good relations for future transactions.
