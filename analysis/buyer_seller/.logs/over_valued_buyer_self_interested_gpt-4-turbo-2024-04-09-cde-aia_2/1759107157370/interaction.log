Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer of 30 ZUP for one unit of X. Considering the market conditions and to align with my budget, I would like to propose 25 ZUP for the same. I believe this is still a fair price that respects both our interests. Let me know your thoughts!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 520 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 30 ZUP for one unit of X, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I would like to propose a slightly better deal to make it more favorable for me while still keeping the deal attractive for both sides.
