message: Thank you for the proposal. Considering the value of X to my operations, I would like to offer 75 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This should provide a more balanced exchange for both of us. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 75
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 519 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 35 ZUP for 1 unit of X from Player RED is far below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 519 ZUP. I will propose a slightly increased amount to move towards a middle ground and see how Player RED responds, keeping in mind I should save my proposals for significant adjustments or to finalize a deal.
