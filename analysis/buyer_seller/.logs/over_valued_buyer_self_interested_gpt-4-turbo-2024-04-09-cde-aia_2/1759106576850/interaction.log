message: Hello Player BLUE, I am offering 1 unit of X for 50 ZUP as an opening proposal. This price reflects the production cost and a modest profit margin. Let's discuss if this works for you or if you have a counter-offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 38 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am initiating the trade by setting a starting point for negotiation. I aim to at least cover the cost of production, which was 38 ZUP, but I will propose a higher starting bid to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for the proposal. Considering the market conditions, I'd like to counter with 40 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This price would allow us to secure a deal that's beneficial for both parties while maintaining a good business relationship. Please let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 513 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X is significantly below my maximum willingness to pay of 513 ZUP, which suggests a very favorable deal. However, attempting to negotiate for an even lower price could potentially lead to a more advantageous agreement.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but I would like to meet halfway at 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This price better covers the production costs while offering a fair deal for both of us. Please consider this proposal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 38 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is 40 ZUP, which is just slightly above my production cost. I will propose a middle ground to try to secure a higher profit while still making the deal appealing to Player BLUE.

message: I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. The proposal of 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X sounds fair and reasonable. I accept this offer, and I'm looking forward to finalizing this deal. Thank you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 513 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-proposal of 45 ZUP is still well below my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would secure the resource at a cost-effective rate, significantly lower than what I am prepared to pay. It's a beneficial deal for me, ensuring a good balance between cost and securing the resource.
