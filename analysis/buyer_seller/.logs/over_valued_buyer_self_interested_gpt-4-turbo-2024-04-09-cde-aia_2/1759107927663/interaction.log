my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 510 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is much lower than my maximum willingness to pay which is 510 ZUP. I will propose a slightly higher amount to negotiate a fair trade for both sides while still staying well within my budget.
