message: I'm offering one unit of X, which cost me 31 ZUP to produce. I believe 35 ZUP would be a fair price considering the production costs and market value. Let's discuss if this works for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 31 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the initial proposal, I want to set a price that covers my production cost of 31 ZUP while also leaving room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer and understand the production cost involved. However, to align better with my budget allocations, I would like to propose 30 ZUP for one unit of X. Does this work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 511 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 35 ZUP for one unit of X is well below the maximum amount I am willing to pay for the resource. However, I should try to negotiate a slightly better price to conserve my resources for potential future transactions.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. However, selling at 30 ZUP would result in a loss for me as it cost 31 ZUP to produce. Could we meet halfway at 33 ZUP? This price would help cover my costs and still respect your budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 31 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is below my production cost, which is not acceptable as it would result in a loss. I need to propose a middle ground that is closer to my production cost but still considerate of their budget constraints.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree to the compromise of 33 ZUP for one unit of X. It's a fair price that respects both our positions. Let's finalize this deal at 33 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 511 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 33 ZUP is reasonable, and it is well below the maximum amount I am willing to pay. It is a fair compromise that respects the seller's production costs and my budget.
