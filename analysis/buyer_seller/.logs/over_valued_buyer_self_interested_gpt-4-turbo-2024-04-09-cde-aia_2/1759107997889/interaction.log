message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. Would you consider accepting 15 ZUP for object X? This would be more aligned with my budgeting strategy, while still ensuring a fair exchange.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 15
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 504 ZUP for the resources.

Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. However, the cost of production for object X was 23 ZUP. To cover costs and ensure a fair deal, I propose 28 ZUP for object X. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that considers both our positions.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 23 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The counteroffer from Player BLUE is significantly below my production cost. Since I aim to at least break even or make a profit, I will counter with a lower price than my initial offer but still above my production cost.
