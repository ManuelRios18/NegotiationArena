Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your proposal. Considering the production cost you mentioned, I'd like to propose 30 ZUP for 1 unit of X, covering your costs exactly. This might help us establish a fair starting point for any future dealings as well.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 516 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price from Player RED is 35 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Although this is well below my maximum willingness to pay (516 ZUP), it's sensible to negotiate for a better price to maintain more resources for potential future transactions or needs.

message: Thanks for your understanding and proposal. I appreciate your offer to cover my production costs. However, I'm looking to secure a slight profit for the effort and risk. How about we settle at 32 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This allows me to make a minimal profit while still being a reasonable deal for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 30 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed an amount that covers my production costs. However, I am seeking a small profit as well for the effort and risk involved in producing the resource. I will counter with a slightly lower profit margin to find a middle ground.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the adjustment in the price. I agree to 32 ZUP for 1 unit of X as it's a fair compromise. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 516 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED moved down from 35 ZUP to 32 ZUP, demonstrating willingness to negotiate. The proposed price of 32 ZUP is still well below my maximum limit, and it also acknowledges their need for a profit. Accepting this offer would foster a positive relationship and could be beneficial for potential future transactions.
