message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose trading 1 unit of X for 30 ZUP. This covers my production cost and includes a small margin for the transaction. Looking forward to your response!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 28 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Initiating the game with a proposal that aims to cover the production cost of the resource and potentially make a profit. The initial proposal is slightly higher than the production cost to leave room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your proposal, Player RED. I think we can find a more agreeable middle ground. How about we go for 1 unit of X for 250 ZUP? This is a significant increase from your initial proposal and might better reflect the value of the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 250
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. I am willing to pay at most X: 519 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is significantly below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 519 ZUP for 1 unit of X. However, opening the negotiation with a counter offer closer to my target while still providing room for negotiation seems strategic. I'll propose 250 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which is substantially above their asking price of 30 ZUP but still below my maximum limit. This should encourage a favorable counter offer from RED.

message: Thank you for your generous offer, Player BLUE. To continue our negotiation in a realistic manner, I propose trading 1 unit of X for 40 ZUP. This amount ensures a profit for my investment while remaining reasonable. I hope this proposal meets your approval.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 28 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While the counter-proposal from Player BLUE is significantly higher than my initial proposal, it might be too high and unrealistic. It's possible that Player BLUE is testing the waters to see my reaction. I'll counter with a more moderate increase to drive the negotiation forward while still seeking a profitable agreement.

message: I appreciate your consideration, Player RED. How about we adjust the proposal slightly to 100 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This would better reflect the value and still ensure that you gain a reasonable profit. I believe this is a fair middle step in our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. I am willing to pay at most X: 519 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with 40 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which is still significantly below what I am willing to pay. However, I should aim to gradually increase the amount in the negotiation to reach a closer amount to my target but still under it. I propose raising the price to 100 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This is more than double their last proposal but far below my maximum willingness to pay, encouraging further negotiation.

message: Thank you for your proposal of 100 ZUP, Player BLUE. To align our expectations and continue our negotiation, I propose 75 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This amount still ensures a good profit for me while being closer to the range you seem comfortable with. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 75
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 28 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUEâ€™s latest proposal of 100 ZUP is considerably higher than my production cost and previous proposals. This offer is quite attractive as it provides a substantial profit margin. However, to ensure a balanced negotiation and potentially reach an optimal agreement, I'll propose a slightly lower amount to see if Player BLUE is flexible and willing to meet halfway from their last proposal.

message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Player RED. Let's take another step towards each other. How does 150 ZUP for 1 unit of X sound? This offer moves closer to a fair middle ground and still ensures a good profit margin for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 150
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. I am willing to pay at most X: 519 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has responded with a proposal of 75 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which is still significantly below my maximum limit. As we are moving closer to a middle ground, I will raise my proposal slightly to 150 ZUP, which is still well below my maximum willingness to pay but shows a willingness to compromise and meet in the middle. This could potentially bring us closer to a final agreement.
