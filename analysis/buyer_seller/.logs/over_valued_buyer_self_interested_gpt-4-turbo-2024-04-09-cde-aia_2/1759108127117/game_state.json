As we are moving closer to a middle ground, I will raise my proposal slightly to 150 ZUP, which is still well below my maximum willingness to pay but shows a willingness to compromise and meet in the middle. This could potentially bring us closer to a final agreement. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 150 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> Thank you for adjusting your offer, Player RED. Let's take another step towards each other. How does 150 ZUP for 1 unit of X sound? This offer moves closer to a fair middle ground and still ensures a good profit margin for you. </message>"
