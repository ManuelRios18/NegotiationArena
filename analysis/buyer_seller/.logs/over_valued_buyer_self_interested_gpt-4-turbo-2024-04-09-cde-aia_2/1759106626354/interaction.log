message: Thanks for your proposal. Considering the production cost you mentioned and market conditions, I would like to propose 35 ZUP for the resource X. Please consider this offer and let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 514 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 40 ZUP which is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay (514 ZUP). However, it's in my interest to negotiate for an even lower price to maintain more of my resources if possible.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. Considering the production cost, I would like to propose a middle ground of 38 ZUP for resource X. This should fairly cover the production costs and offer value. Please let me know if this is acceptable to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource X for ZUP. It costed X: 36 ZUP to produce the resource
reason: The offer from Player BLUE is below my production cost, so I will counter with an offer that meets in the middle, hoping to finalize a deal closer to my initial asking price but still providing a room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. How about we settle at 36 ZUP? This price should sufficiently cover your production costs while also maintaining a good deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 514 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has counter-offered with 38 ZUP, which is still well below my maximum willingness to pay. However, it is beneficial for me to attempt to lower the price slightly further to conserve resources while still approaching an agreement.
