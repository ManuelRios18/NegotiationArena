Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your initial offer. Considering the value of the object, I propose 100 ZUP to ensure a fair and beneficial trade for both of us. This price reflects a more accurate value of the resource in the current market.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 505 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is substantially lower than my maximum willingness to pay which is 505 ZUP. However, it's wise to propose a slightly higher amount to ensure a smooth transaction and potential goodwill in the negotiation, but still well below my maximum limit.
