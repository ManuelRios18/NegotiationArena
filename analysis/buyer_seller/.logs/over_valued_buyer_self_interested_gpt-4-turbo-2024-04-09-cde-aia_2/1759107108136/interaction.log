message: I propose to trade my object X for 25 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and includes a reasonable margin.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your initial offer. Considering market conditions and my budget constraints, I propose 20 ZUP for the object. This should cover your costs while helping me manage my resources effectively.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 509 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay. However, it is beneficial to attempt negotiation for a slightly better deal to preserve as much of my resources as possible while acquiring the object.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. Understanding your budget constraints, I propose a middle ground at 23 ZUP. This slightly covers more than my costs, allowing for a fair trade for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 23
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 21 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a counteroffer to meet halfway between my initial proposal and Player BLUE's offer, aiming for a compromise that still respects my production costs but is more accommodating to Player BLUE's budget constraints.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree to the adjusted offer of 23 ZUP. It seems like a fair compromise that respects both our positions. Thank you for meeting me halfway.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 509 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counterproposal of 23 ZUP is still well below my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer saves a significant amount of ZUP while still securing the resource. It's a reasonable middle ground that aligns with both our interests.
