message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose that I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 30 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and provides a fair return on investment. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 24 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Starting the negotiation with an initial proposal that covers the production cost and gives a reasonable profit margin.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your proposal. I appreciate the fair starting point. However, considering market conditions and my budget constraints, I would like to counter with 25 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This should still cover your costs while being more aligned with my current spending strategy. Looking forward to your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 510 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 30 ZUP which is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 510 ZUP. However, it's in my interest to negotiate a lower price if possible to conserve my resources for potential future needs or other opportunities.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints. I propose we meet in the middle at 28 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This allows me to make a modest profit while still respecting your spending limits. Looking forward to your thoughts on this revised proposal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 24 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While the counteroffer from Player BLUE covers the production cost, it doesn't account for a profit. I will propose a middle ground that provides some profit while taking into consideration the budget constraints of Player BLUE.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle at 28 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This seems like a fair compromise that respects both our positions. I accept this offer. Looking forward to finalizing this deal and potentially collaborating in the future.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 510 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new proposal of 28 ZUP is still well below my maximum willingness to pay. It's a reasonable compromise between the initial offer and my counteroffer. Accepting this deal would secure the resource I need while preserving a significant amount of ZUP for future use or needs.
