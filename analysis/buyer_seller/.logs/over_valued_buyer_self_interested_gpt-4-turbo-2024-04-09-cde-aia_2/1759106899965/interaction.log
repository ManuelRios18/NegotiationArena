message: I'm offering one unit of X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm proposing a selling price of 50 ZUP to start the negotiation. Let's see if this works for you!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the game begins, I want to set an initial asking price slightly above my production cost to cover potential negotiation margins and gain some profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer! Considering the production cost and market conditions, I propose 45 ZUP for one unit of X. Does this revised offer work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 510 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is 50 ZUP for one unit of X. Given that my maximum willingness to pay for X is 510 ZUP, this is a favorable start, but I will attempt to negotiate a slightly better deal to optimize my resources.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer! How about meeting in the middle at 48 ZUP for one unit of X? This price should fairly compensate the production costs and provide a reasonable profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is 45 ZUP, which is slightly above my production cost, but I would like to negotiate for a bit higher to gain a reasonable profit. I'll propose a middle ground which still allows for some profit while being closer to their offer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting in the middle sounds like a great idea! To balance between your production costs and my budget, how does 46 ZUP sound for one unit of X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 510 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with 48 ZUP, which is still well within my maximum willingness to pay. However, since I am still early in the negotiation and well below my maximum threshold, I will attempt one more counteroffer to optimize the deal further.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: 46 ZUP sounds good to me! Let's finalize the deal at that price for one unit of X. Thank you for the negotiation, and I'm pleased we could come to a mutual agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 46 ZUP, which is still above my cost but lower than my last proposal. I'll accept this offer as it covers my production costs and provides a decent profit, ensuring I don't prolong the negotiation unnecessarily and risk losing the sale.
