message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I am considering the costs as well and would like to counter-propose with 35 ZUP for one unit of X. This helps me manage my resources more efficiently while still providing you with a profit. Letâ€™s work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 505 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is offering one unit of X for 40 ZUP. Given I am willing to pay up to 505 ZUP for the resources, this initial offer is significantly lower than my maximum threshold. However, it is always good to negotiate for a better price to conserve resources where possible. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if they are open to further negotiation.
