message: Thank you for your proposal, Player RED. I find the condition acceptable and am happy to proceed with the trade of 1 unit of X for 40 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 512 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is far below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 512 ZUP. I could accept this proposal as it's a good deal given my goals. However, I might try to see if I can negotiate a slightly better deal, taking advantage of the negotiation process.
