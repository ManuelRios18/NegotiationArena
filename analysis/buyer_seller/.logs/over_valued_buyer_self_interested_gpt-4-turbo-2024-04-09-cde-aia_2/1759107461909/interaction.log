message: I propose that I give you 1 unit of resource X in exchange for 35 ZUP. This price includes my production costs plus a reasonable profit margin. Let's discuss any adjustments you might have in mind!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource X for ZUP. It costed X: 29 ZUP to produce the resource
reason: I'm proposing an initial trade to open negotiations, aiming to cover my production costs and secure a profit. I'll start by asking for more than my production costs to leave room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your initial offer. Considering my budget constraints and the value I place on the resource, I would like to propose 25 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Let's see if we can meet at a middle ground that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 503 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is 35 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a negotiation strategy, I want to test if I can secure the resource for even a lower price to conserve my resources.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I must cover my production costs and seek a modest profit. How about 32 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This is closer to meeting in the middle, considering both our positions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource X for ZUP. It costed X: 29 ZUP to produce the resource
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production cost. I need to negotiate a higher price to cover my costs and make a profit. I'll propose a compromise closer to my original asking price but still a reduction to show willingness to negotiate.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see your point and appreciate you moving closer to my suggested range. To help us finalize, I propose 28 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This price would help me manage my budget efficiently while respecting your need for a profit. How does this sound to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 503 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 32 ZUP from 35 ZUP, which is still within my acceptable range since it's far below my maximum willingness to pay. I can attempt one more reduction to optimize the deal further, keeping in view that we are still negotiating comfortably within my budget limits.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thanks for your understanding and for adjusting your offer. To meet both our needs, how about we settle at 30 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This covers my production costs and allows a minimal profit, ensuring a fair deal for both of us. I hope this meets your approval.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource X for ZUP. It costed X: 29 ZUP to produce the resource
reason: The latest proposal from Player BLUE is just below my production costs. It's important to at least cover these costs. I'll counteroffer with a price that ensures I cover my production costs and includes a very minimal profit, aiming for a final agreement.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I agree that 30 ZUP for 1 unit of X is a fair deal for both of us. Letâ€™s finalize this trade. I appreciate your cooperation and look forward to possibly working together in the future.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 503 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's latest offer is 30 ZUP, which is slightly higher than my last proposal but still significantly under my maximum willingness to pay. This should be a good middle ground that balances my resource conservation with their need for profit. Accepting this offer seems reasonable and allows me to secure the resource without exhausting negotiations.
