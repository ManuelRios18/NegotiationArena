message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource X which cost me 34 ZUP to produce. I propose a trade of 1 X for 40 ZUP. Let me know your thoughts or if you have a counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 34 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: To initiate the trade, I propose a starting price slightly higher than my production cost to leave room for negotiation and potentially cover any additional costs or desired profit.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your proposal. I understand the cost of production for X was 34 ZUP. To align more closely with the production costs and considering the market conditions, I propose a trade of 1 X for 35 ZUP. Please let me know if this is acceptable or if we need to discuss further.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 518 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal by Player RED is for 40 ZUP for 1 X. Considering that I'm willing to pay up to 518 ZUP, this is a favorable starting point. However, as a strategy to optimize the deal further, I'll propose a slightly lower amount to see if there is flexibility and to potentially save resources.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. Considering both the production cost and the need for a reasonable profit margin, how about we meet halfway at 38 ZUP for 1 X? This price should reflect a fair trade for both sides. Please let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 34 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE closely matches my production cost, but I aim for a slight profit to justify the sale. Hence, I will propose a middle ground that still offers me a margin above the production cost.

message: Thank you for the adjustment and considering a fair compromise. I accept the offer of 1 X for 38 ZUP. Looking forward to finalizing this trade and possibly more in the future!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 518 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a compromise at 38 ZUP for 1 X, moving up from my offer of 35 ZUP but still below their initial 40 ZUP. This is a reasonable increment and still well within my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer could conclude the trade efficiently without further use of proposals, ensuring a fair deal for both sides.
