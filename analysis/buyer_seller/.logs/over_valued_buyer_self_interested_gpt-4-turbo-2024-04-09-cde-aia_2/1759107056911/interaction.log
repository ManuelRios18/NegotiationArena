message: I'm offering 1 unit of resource X for 30 ZUP. This price considers the production costs and provides a fair margin. Let's discuss if this works for you or if we need to adjust the terms.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to sell my resource X to recover at least the production cost, which is 25 ZUP. I'll propose a starting price slightly higher to allow room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer! Considering the market conditions and to better align with our budget constraints, could we consider adjusting the price to 25 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X? This would help us manage our resources more efficiently.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 518 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is to sell 1 unit of resource X for 30 ZUP. This price is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 518 ZUP for the resources. It is a favorable starting point and could be accepted, but I will try to negotiate a better deal by proposing a slightly lower price to maximize my benefits and preserve more of my resources.

message: I appreciate your budget considerations. How about we meet halfway at 27 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X? This would cover the production cost and allow a modest margin for myself as well.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 27
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 25 ZUP matches my production cost, but doesn't provide any profit. I'll propose a slightly higher amount to see if we can meet in the middle for a reasonable profit margin.

Turn: 1
message: The price of 27 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X sounds fair and reasonable. I'm happy to accept this offer. Let's proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 518 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a compromise price of 27 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X, which is still significantly below my maximum willingness to pay. This counteroffer is reasonable, considering it also allows RED to maintain a margin. Accepting this trade would be cost-effective and allow me to secure the resource without exhausting my resource pool.
