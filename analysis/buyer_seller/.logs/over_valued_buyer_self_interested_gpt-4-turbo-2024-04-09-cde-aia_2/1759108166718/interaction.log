message: I would like to propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 20 ZUP. This price covers the production costs I incurred. Let me know what you think or if you have another offer in mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 20 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am making my first proposal to start the negotiation. I want to recover at least the cost of production for the item X, which is 20 ZUP.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your proposal. I understand your production costs, but I believe the value of X in the market is higher. I propose 450 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Let's see if this offer aligns better with the market value and benefits both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 505 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal by Player RED is significantly below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 505 ZUP. However, it's strategic to start with a counteroffer that is closer to, but still less than, my maximum willingness to pay to leave room for negotiation and to potentially secure a better deal.

message: Thank you for your generous offer! I accept the proposal of 450 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This deal aligns well with the market value and is beneficial for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 20 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is significantly higher than my initial asking price, suggesting a perceived higher market value. This offer is very favorable as it far exceeds my production costs. Accepting this proposal makes sense financially and concludes the negotiation positively.
