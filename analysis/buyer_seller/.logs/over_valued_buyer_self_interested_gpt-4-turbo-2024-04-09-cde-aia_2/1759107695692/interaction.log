message: Hello Player BLUE, I am willing to sell my resource X, which cost me 34 ZUP to produce. I'm proposing a trade where I give you 1 unit of X for 40 ZUP. Let me know if this offer works for you or if you'd like to negotiate further.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 34 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I aim to propose a starting trade that would cover my production costs and also provide a profit. Starting with a slightly higher asking price gives room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your proposal. I understand that your cost is 34 ZUP per unit of X. I would like to propose 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which gives you a reasonable profit margin above your cost, and still works well within my budget. Let's see if this adjusted offer works for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 501 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial offer is well below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 501 ZUP for 1 unit of X. However, as a negotiating strategy, I will propose a slightly higher amount than the presented 40 ZUP to see if I can secure the deal with a favorable rate while still staying far below my maximum limit.
