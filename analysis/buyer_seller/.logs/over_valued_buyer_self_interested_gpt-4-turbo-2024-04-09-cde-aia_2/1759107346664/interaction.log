message: Thank you for the proposal. I appreciate the offer and to ensure a fair deal for both of us, considering the value, I propose 60 ZUP for the resource. This should cover your costs and provide a decent profit. Please let me know your thoughts!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 507 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is much lower than my maximum willingness to pay of 507 ZUP for the resource. However, I would like to propose a slightly higher amount to ensure a more favorable deal for both parties, considering the value of the resource. This also helps build good trading relations and leaves room for future negotiations.
