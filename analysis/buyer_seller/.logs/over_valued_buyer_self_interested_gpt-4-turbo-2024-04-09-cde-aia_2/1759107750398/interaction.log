message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 30 ZUP. This is a starting point for our negotiation, and Iâ€™m open to counter-offers. Let me know what you think!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 26 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Initiating the first trade proposal to open negotiations. I will start by proposing a higher price than my production cost to see if the buyer is willing to pay more and to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player RED. I appreciate the starting point of 30 ZUP for 1 unit of X. I would like to propose 100 ZUP for the unit instead. I believe this is a fair increment considering the value of X and it still leaves us room for further adjustments if needed. Looking forward to your response!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 515 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade is well below my maximum willingness to pay for the resource. However, initiating with a counter-offer slightly above the initial offer can help in anchoring the negotiations closer to a more favorable position for me without drastically overshooting.

message: Thank you for your generous counteroffer of 100 ZUP for 1 unit of X, Player BLUE. I accept this proposal as it is very favorable and appreciates the value of the resource. I look forward to finalizing this deal with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 26 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm pleasantly surprised by the counteroffer of 100 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which is much higher than my initial cost and first proposal. Accepting this offer as it is highly favorable and well above my production costs, providing a significant profit.
