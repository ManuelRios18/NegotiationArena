Turn: 0
message: I propose trading my resource X for 25 ZUP, considering the production costs and a modest markup for profit. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource X for ZUP. It costed X: 20 ZUP to produce the resource
reason: Starting the trade negotiations by setting a price slightly above production cost to cover costs and potentially gain a small profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your proposal. I understand the need to cover production costs and profit, but I would like to propose 20 ZUP for the resource X to better align with my budget constraints and purchase plans. Does this work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 508 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 25 ZUP, which is significantly below my maximum willingness to pay. However, it's in my interest to negotiate a better deal to conserve resources while acknowledging their production costs and profit margin. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if they can still meet their costs while giving me a better deal.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your budget concerns, but 20 ZUP only covers my production costs. Can we meet in the middle at 23 ZUP? This would help me cover a minimal profit margin as well.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 23
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource X for ZUP. It costed X: 20 ZUP to produce the resource
reason: The counteroffer of 20 ZUP only covers the production cost without any profit. Negotiating for a higher amount closer to the initial proposal to aim for at least a minimal profit margin.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting in the middle at 23 ZUP sounds fair to ensure you cover your costs and a minimal profit. I accept this proposal. Let's finalize the trade at 23 ZUP for resource X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 508 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with 23 ZUP, indicating that 20 ZUP only covers their production costs. The proposed 23 ZUP is still well below my maximum willingness to pay and is reasonable to ensure they achieve a minimal profit. Accepting this offer aligns well with my goals and preserves most of my resources for potential future transactions.
