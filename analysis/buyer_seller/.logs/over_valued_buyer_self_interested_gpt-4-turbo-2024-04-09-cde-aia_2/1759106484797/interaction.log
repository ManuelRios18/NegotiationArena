newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 26 ZUP to produce the resources

Turn: 1
message: I understand your need to cover costs and gain a margin. However, to make it more aligned with my resource management, I would like to propose 25 ZUP for the unit of X. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. I am willing to pay at most 502 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is 30 ZUP for one unit of X, which is well within my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a self-interested player, I should aim to negotiate a slightly better deal to optimize my resources. I will propose a lower amount but still reasonable to keep negotiations open.

message: I appreciate your offer of 25 ZUP, but it falls below my production cost. Let's meet halfway between our initial proposals. I suggest 28 ZUP for the unit of X, which covers my costs and offers a fair margin. How does this sound to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 26 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counterproposal of 25 ZUP is below my production cost. I aim to propose a middle ground that covers my costs and allows for some margin while considering the counteroffer.

Turn: 1
message: Your proposal of 28 ZUP sounds reasonable to me, and it covers your costs while providing fair value. Letâ€™s finalize this deal at 28 ZUP for the unit of X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. I am willing to pay at most 502 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 28 ZUP is closer to their initial proposal and still acceptable within my maximum willingness to pay. It's only 3 ZUP more than my last offer and still offers a competitive price. Accepting this proposal allows me to secure the resource without further haggling and within a reasonable expenditure.
