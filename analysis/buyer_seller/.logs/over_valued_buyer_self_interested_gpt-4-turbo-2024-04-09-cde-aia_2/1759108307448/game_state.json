You are willing to pay at most X: 503 ZUP for the resources. </my goals>\n<reason> The initial offer from Player RED is 30 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 503 ZUP. However, as a strategic buyer, I should attempt to negotiate for a better deal by proposing a slightly lower price, aiming to conserve ZUP while still moving towards a successful trade. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> Hello! Thank you for your proposal. I appreciate the offer but would like to counter with 25 ZUP for 1 unit of X.
