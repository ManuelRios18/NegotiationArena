message: Hello! Thank you for your proposal. I appreciate the offer but would like to counter with 25 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This adjustment helps me better align with my budget constraints while still ensuring a fair trade for both of us. I look forward to your thoughts on this.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 503 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 30 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which is well below my maximum willingness to pay of 503 ZUP. However, as a strategic buyer, I should attempt to negotiate for a better deal by proposing a slightly lower price, aiming to conserve ZUP while still moving towards a successful trade.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand the need to align with your budget. However, considering the production costs, I'd like to propose a slightly adjusted price of 28 ZUP for 1 unit of X. I believe this meets us halfway and should be a fair adjustment for both sides. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 22 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my initial asking price and does not cover my production costs and desired profit margin adequately. I will make a counterproposal that meets closer to the middle ground to try and secure a deal that is beneficial for both parties.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my budget in your counteroffer. I suggest we meet a bit closer to my last proposal, at 26 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This price would allow us to finalize the deal efficiently while maintaining fairness to both parties. Looking forward to your response!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 26
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 503 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED countered with 28 ZUP for 1 unit of X, a compromise between my proposal and their original offer. This price is still well within my acceptable range but I believe there's room to negotiate for a slightly better deal, aiming to conserve more of my ZUP. Thus, I will make another counteroffer.

message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate further. Let's settle at 27 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This price should be a fair compromise for both of us, covering my production costs and offering you a reasonable purchase price. I hope this proposal meets your approval for us to proceed with the deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 27
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 22 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a slightly higher offer, but it is still not meeting my target of covering costs and ensuring a reasonable profit margin. I will make one more counterproposal that gets closer to my initial asking price but still offers a compromise.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for working with me through these negotiations. I accept your proposal of 27 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This price is fair, and I'm pleased we've reached an amicable agreement. Let's proceed with the deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 503 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's latest proposal of 27 ZUP for 1 unit of X is a fair middle ground, only 1 ZUP more than my last counteroffer. This price is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay and still within a reasonable range for conserving my resources. Accepting this offer would finalize the deal effectively, maintaining a good trade relationship.
