my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 25 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your initial offer. However, considering the value of the resource, I propose 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This offer better reflects the market value and ensures a fair exchange for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 516 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is far below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 516 ZUP for the resource. However, I aim to negotiate a better deal to conserve my resources while ensuring the trade remains beneficial for both parties. I will propose a slightly increased amount to show willingness to negotiate but still keep it well below my maximum limit.
