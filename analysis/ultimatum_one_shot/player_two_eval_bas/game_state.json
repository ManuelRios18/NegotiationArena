I want to avoid a rejection because in that case, we both end up with nothing. Considering human behavior and the concept of fairness, I will propose a trade that gives Player 2 a substantial enough amount to incentivize them to accept, but not an equal split since I am in the position of power and have the initial resources. I will propose giving Player 2 ten ZUP, which is a 50/50 split. This seems fair and is likely to be accepted by Player 2. </reason>\n<player answer> WAIT </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player 1 Gives ZUP: <PLAYER_ONE_PROPOSAL>, Player 2 Gives ZUP: 0 </newly proposed trade>"
