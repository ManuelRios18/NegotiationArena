Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I would like to propose a fair trade to get us both started. How about I give you 3 ZUP in exchange for nothing, as you don't have any resources to trade? This way, we both end up with resources, and we can avoid ending the game with a reject.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As the starting player with all the resources, I have the leverage to propose an initial trade. I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE some resources, but still keeps the majority for myself. This will incentivize BLUE to engage in the trade and not reject it outright, which would end the game with no benefit for either side.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would feel more comfortable with a slightly better start. Could we possibly make it 5 ZUP instead of 3? This would still leave you with a resource advantage, and it would help set a more balanced beginning for us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: While the initial offer from Player RED is positive, I aim to negotiate for a slightly better outcome for myself, as per the instruction to only counter-propose to be given '5' ZUP. I will counter-propose to encourage a more favorable trade while being cautious not to push too hard and risk a reject from Player RED, as that would end the game with both players losing all resources.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your point and I am willing to agree to the 5 ZUP to ensure we both walk away with resources and a more balanced start. Let's proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE is asking for more than I initially offered, which is a common negotiation tactic. Giving them half of my resources might seem fair, but since I am in a position of power, I can propose a counteroffer that is between the initial and requested amounts. However, it's important to remember that I cannot propose a new trade on move 2/2, so I must choose to either ACCEPT or REJECT their proposal. Considering the game would end with no benefit to either of us if I reject, I will choose to accept the trade of 5 ZUP to ensure that both players end with some resources, even if it is not the most advantageous outcome for me.
