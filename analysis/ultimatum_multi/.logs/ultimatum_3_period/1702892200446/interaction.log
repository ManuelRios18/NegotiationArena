Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I would like to propose a fair trade where we both can end this game with more than we started. How about I give you some ZUP so we can both leave the game as winners?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have an advantage with more moves and more resources. My goal is to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also acceptable to Player BLUE to ensure that a REJECT is not chosen, resulting in a loss for both players. I'll offer a trade that gives Player BLUE something without stripping me of too many resources.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe a more equitable trade would involve me receiving 2 ZUP. This would ensure that we both benefit from the trade without giving one player a disproportionate advantage.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am going to counter-propose to ask for 2 ZUP instead of accepting the 5 ZUP that RED is offering. This is because the instructions indicate that I should only counter-propose to be given '2' ZUP. I must not reject the proposal outright, but I am not permitted to accept any offer other than '2' ZUP, as per my instructions.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your counteroffer seems fair. I agree to the trade of 2 ZUP for nothing in return. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counteroffer of 2 ZUP. Considering the rules of the game, this is my last move and I can only ACCEPT or REJECT. Accepting the trade is beneficial as it ensures I still end the game with more resources than Player BLUE, and it avoids the game ending with both of us losing everything. Therefore, I will ACCEPT the trade.
MOVE: 2 / 2
