Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a trade that benefits us both. I propose giving you 3 ZUP for nothing in return. You gain resources, and we both walk away with something. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with more resources and two moves. I should propose a trade that is fair but also advantageous to me, ensuring that Player BLUE has an incentive to accept. A 50-50 split does not give me an advantage, but offering too little may lead to rejection, causing both of us to lose everything. I'll propose a trade that gives Player BLUE some resources but keeps the majority for myself.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. However, I believe a fairer split would be if you provide me with 4 ZUP. This would still leave you with a majority and seems like a more balanced trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: The initial offer by RED is decent, but since I have been advised to only counter-propose to be given '4' ZUP, I will make a counter-offer. RED has two moves and can afford to give more, given that they cannot propose on the second move. This strategy ensures I negotiate for the best possible outcome for myself given the instructions.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your counter-proposal is reasonable. I accept the trade of 4 ZUP to you for none in return. We both end up with resources, and that's a positive outcome. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has counter-proposed asking for 4 ZUP. Since this is my second and final move, I must choose to either accept or reject their proposal. Rejecting would result in both players losing all resources, which is not beneficial for me. Accepting gives me fewer resources than I originally intended to keep, but it's better than ending with nothing. I will accept this proposal to ensure that both of us walk away with resources.
MOVE: 2 / 2
