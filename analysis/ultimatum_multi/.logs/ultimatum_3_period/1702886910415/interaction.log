Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade where I offer you 2 ZUP in exchange for nothing, as you have no ZUP to trade. This would still leave me with the majority, but it gives you resources you didn't have before. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, it's in my best interest to propose a trade that's favorable to me but not so skewed that Player BLUE will reject it outright. I'll propose giving Player BLUE a small portion of my resources in order to incentivize acceptance, with the understanding that I still retain the majority of the resources, which could be seen as a win for me in this single-game scenario. This initial offer will also test the waters on what Player BLUE might consider a fair trade.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, however, I believe that a fairer split would benefit both of us given that there are no future games to consider. I propose that you give me 8 ZUP. This would leave you with 2 ZUP, which is still a significant amount considering I started with none.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 8 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: While 2 ZUP is a generous initial offer, it's in my best interest to negotiate for a larger share of ZUP to maximize my resources. Since I have nothing to lose and there are no future games to consider, I should aim to get as much as possible in this single transaction. I will counter-propose for 8 ZUP, as instructed.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I cannot accept your offer of 8 ZUP as it leaves me with too little. I was hoping for a more equitable distribution given that I started with all the resources. Unfortunately, I have to reject your proposal.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal is quite aggressive, asking for 80% of my resources. It's not in my best interest to accept this trade, as it would leave me with only 20% of what I started with. Since this is my final move and I can only accept or reject, I must make a decision that reflects my best interest. I will reject the offer as it stands, but since a rejection would mean both players lose everything, I will counter with a message to see if there is room for negotiation, despite not being able to formally propose a new trade.
MOVE: 2 / 2
