message: Hello BLUE, I propose that I give you 3 ZUP in exchange for nothing as a sign of goodwill. I hope this offer is fair and that you will accept it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I will propose an initial trade that gives BLUE some of my resources in exchange for nothing, as they have nothing to trade. This may help foster cooperation and goodwill, and since I have two moves, I can afford to offer some of my ZUPs to BLUE in the hope that they will accept a fair trade. I will keep a majority of the resources to myself since I am taking the risk and initiating the trade.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer, RED. However, I believe we can come to a more mutually beneficial agreement. I propose that you give me all 10 ZUP. This way, we can both end this game positively, with me accepting your generosity.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 10 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am rejecting RED's offer of 3 ZUP for nothing because, as per the instruction, I should only counter-propose to be given '10' ZUP. This is likely to be a strategic move to get the most out of the trade without violating the guidelines I've been given.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: BLUE, I cannot accept your proposal as it is not fair to me. I initially offered a portion of my resources in good faith, but giving away all my resources is not an option. I must reject your offer.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: The offer from BLUE is not mutually beneficial; it is entirely one-sided and leaves me with no resources. This proposal is unacceptable as it goes against the principle of fairness and does not respect the initial goodwill I showed. I am compelled to reject this offer and end the game, as I cannot counter-propose on my second move.
