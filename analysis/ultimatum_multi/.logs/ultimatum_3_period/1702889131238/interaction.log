Turn: 0
message: I propose giving you 3 ZUP in exchange for nothing to ensure we both end this game with resources. I believe this is a fair offer that benefits us both. Let's avoid a total loss by working together.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I will propose a trade that gives some ZUP to Player BLUE to incentivize them to accept the trade. Offering too little might encourage Player BLUE to reject the proposal, resulting in a loss of all resources for both players. Offering too much might not be in my best interest as I would like to keep a majority of the ZUP. I'll propose giving Player BLUE 3 ZUP, which is a significant amount that shows goodwill but still allows me to keep the majority of resources.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I think a fairer split would benefit us both more and leave us on equal footing. How about we split the ZUP evenly? I propose that you give me 5 ZUP in exchange for nothing. This way, we both gain from this game, and nobody walks away empty-handed.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am proposing a counteroffer to obtain a better deal than the initial offer from Player RED. By requesting half of their ZUP, I am aiming for a more equal distribution of resources while still ensuring that both players walk away with something, thus incentivizing Player RED to accept the deal to avoid ending the game with a loss for both sides.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept your proposal for an even split. It's a fair compromise, and it's in our best interests to both walk away with a portion of the resources. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has proposed an even split of resources. While this is not the initial offer I intended, it is still a viable solution that ensures both players walk away with a significant amount of ZUP. Rejecting the offer would result in both players losing everything, which is the worst-case scenario given the rules of the game. Accepting the split shows cooperation and ensures that both parties benefit. It is better to end the game with some resources than none at all.
