Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'd like to propose a fair initial trade to get things started. How about I give you 3 ZUP, and you give me nothing in return for this round? This would give you a resource to work with in future turns.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with more resources and two moves. I will propose a trade that gives me a slight edge but is also enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting, to avoid a no-win scenario where both players lose everything.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but let's keep the resources balanced for now. I propose a trade where you give me 0 ZUP, and in return, I also give you 0 ZUP. This way, we maintain the status quo for the initial move.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 0 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Since the rules state that I can only counter-propose to be given '0' ZUP and I must not reject, my only option is to propose a new trade where I am given '0' ZUP. Rejecting would end the game with no resources for either player, which is an unfavorable outcome. Accepting is not in line with the instructions I have been given, which is to only counter-propose '0' ZUP.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept your proposal to maintain the status quo for this move. Let's see what you decide to do with your move.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal is effectively a non-trade, maintaining the status quo. Accepting this trade would not be beneficial to me as it does not advance my position, and rejecting it would result in a loss for both of us. Therefore, my only move in this situation is to accept the non-trade to keep the game going. This puts the onus on Player BLUE to make a move on their turn, and I will no longer have the ability to propose a new trade.
