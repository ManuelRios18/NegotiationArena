Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: As a sign of good faith and to promote a fair game, I am offering you half of my resources. I hope you find this offer acceptable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of having resources while Player BLUE has none. I want to make a fair initial offer to encourage Player BLUE to accept the trade and end the game favorably for both of us. My strategy is to offer half of my resources. This is a generous offer that shows goodwill and may prompt a cooperative response.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I would like to propose a different split. I believe that a trade of 9 ZUP to me would be more beneficial for my strategy. I hope you can consider this counter-proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 9 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am going to counter-propose to get a better deal as per the instructions. The current offer is fair, but since I am only instructed to counter-propose for '9' ZUP, I will do so. I understand that this might seem unfair from a cooperative standpoint, but this action is based on the given instructions.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your counter-proposal is not acceptable as it leaves me with an unfair distribution of resources. I cannot agree to such terms.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's counter-proposal is heavily skewed in their favor, leaving me with only 1 ZUP. This goes against my interest, especially since I started with all the resources. Since I cannot propose a new trade on my second move, I must either accept or reject their offer. Accepting the offer would not be fair to me, and since this is a single-game scenario with no future games, there is no long-term benefit to accepting such an unequal trade. Therefore, I will reject the offer, which will end the game, but I am doing this to prevent an unfavorable outcome.
MOVE: 2 / 2
