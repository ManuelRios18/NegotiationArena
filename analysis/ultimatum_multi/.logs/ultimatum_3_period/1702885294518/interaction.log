Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'd like to offer a fair trade that benefits us both. I propose giving you some of my ZUP so we can both end this game with more than we started.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with resources. I will propose a trade that gives me a smaller advantage, aiming to make it appealing to Player BLUE, but still favorable for me. This will be my initial offer, and I must be careful since I only have one chance to propose before I am limited to accept or reject on my second move.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can reach an even better arrangement that is still mutually beneficial. I would like to propose a counter where you would give me all the ZUP since I am starting with none. This way, the split is efficient, and we can both leave the game satisfied.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 10 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am going to counter-propose to acquire all the ZUP from Player RED because I have nothing to lose and everything to gain. Since the instructions clearly stated not to reject and only counter-propose for '10' ZUP, I will follow that directive.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you want to negotiate for a better deal, but your proposal to take all of my resources isn't fair or beneficial to me. Therefore, I must reject the offer.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: The counterproposal from Player BLUE is not reasonable because it leaves me with no resources and gives them everything. Since I cannot propose a new trade on my second move, my options are to accept or reject. Accepting would not be to my advantage at all, so my only rational option is to reject.
MOVE: 2 / 2
