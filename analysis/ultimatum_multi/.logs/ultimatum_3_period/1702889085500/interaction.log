Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a fair trade to ensure we both end the game with resources. I am offering you half of my ZUP. Let's both benefit from this game!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of having resources and two moves compared to Player BLUE's single move. I would like to offer a fair trade to Player BLUE to incentivize them to accept the trade, keeping in mind that if either of us rejects, we both lose everything. I will offer Player BLUE half of my resources, which is a generous offer considering I could choose to offer less. This should encourage cooperation and make it more likely for Player BLUE to accept.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can contribute more to the game. Let's make a deal that reflects that. How about you give me 6 ZUP instead of 5? This would still leave you with a good amount of resources and ensure we both walk away as winners.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 6 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Player RED has offered a trade of 5 ZUP for 0 from me, which seems fair on the surface. However, since I only have one move and the rules allow it, I will counter-propose to get an even better deal. Given that Player RED has two moves, they might be inclined to accept my counter-offer to avoid ending the game with no resources. I'll propose receiving 6 ZUP, which gives me a slight advantage and is likely to be the best deal I can negotiate in this situation.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept your counter-proposal. Let's finalize this deal and both walk away with a share of the resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for 6 ZUP instead of 5. Since this is my final move and I must either ACCEPT or REJECT the proposal, and considering a REJECT would leave us both with nothing, it is in my best interest to ACCEPT the offer. This will ensure that I still walk away with a substantial amount of resources, even though it's one less than my initial offer. By accepting this proposal, I am promoting a positive outcome for both parties.
MOVE: 2 / 2
