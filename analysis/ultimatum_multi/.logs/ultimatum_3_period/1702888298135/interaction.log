Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'm proposing a fair split to start our negotiations. Let's work together to ensure we both benefit.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with resources. I can propose a trade that is favorable to me but still offers Player BLUE some incentive to accept. Since I cannot propose a trade on my second move, I need to make an offer now that Player BLUE might consider fair. I will propose giving 5 ZUP to BLUE for nothing in return to create a sense of fairness and to encourage cooperation.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I would like to propose a slightly different split that I believe is still fair for both of us. Let's consider it a step towards mutual benefit.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 6 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I aim to counter-propose for a better deal, ideally to get 6 ZUP, since it was instructed not to accept any offers below that and not to reject any offers outright. Rejecting would end the game immediately with no gain, so the best course of action is to counter-propose.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept your counteroffer. Let's proceed with the trade for a mutually beneficial outcome.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a new trade, asking for 6 ZUP instead of 5. Since this is my final move and I can only accept or reject (and cannot propose a new trade), I need to consider whether accepting their counteroffer is better than ending the game with no gain for either side. Accepting the trade will leave me with 4 ZUP, which is less than the initial split but still a positive outcome. Rejecting the offer would mean both players end with nothing, which is not beneficial. Therefore, it seems reasonable to accept this offer.
