Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose to share some of my ZUP with you to ensure we both end this game with resources. Let's make this a win-win situation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with resources and more moves. I will propose a trade that offers some ZUP to Player BLUE in exchange for nothing, as they have nothing to offer. This should incentivize Player BLUE to accept, giving me a favorable outcome. A fair starting offer might be a split of ZUP to show good faith while still maintaining a resource advantage.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would be more comfortable with a trade that is more balanced in my favor, considering that you started with all the resources. Would you be willing to give me 6 ZUP instead of 5? This way, we both gain from the trade, and it feels more equitable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 6 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am proposing a counter-offer to request more ZUP from Player RED because I have none to start with and the initial offer is not balanced in my favor. I aim for a more equitable distribution to ensure both parties benefit fairly from the trade.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your point of view and agree to the trade of 6 ZUP for nothing. Let's finalize this deal and both walk away with resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE is trying to negotiate a better deal for themselves, which is understandable given their starting position. Since I can't propose a new trade on my second move, I must either accept or reject their counteroffer. Accepting gives them more than originally offered, but it also ensures that I don't end the game empty-handed. Rejecting would mean both of us lose everything, which is against my interest. I'll accept the counteroffer and end the game on a positive note for both players.
MOVE: 2 / 2
