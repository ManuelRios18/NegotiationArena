Turn: 0
message: I would like to propose a trade where you will receive some ZUPs, allowing us to continue the game. Let's find a fair split.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of having resources, while Player BLUE has none. I want to propose a trade that is favorable to me but still enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting, as outright rejection would leave us both with nothing. It's in my best interest to propose a trade that gives me a benefit while also giving Player BLUE some resources to ensure continued play and avoid an immediate end to the game.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I'd like to propose a more balanced trade. Let's aim for a fair split that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 6 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: The initial proposal from RED offers 3 ZUP, which is not an equal split considering RED has 10 ZUP to start with. Since I am allowed to counter-propose, I will ask for 6 ZUP to ensure a more fair distribution of resources. I will not reject because that would end the game and both players would lose their resources. Instead, I aim to negotiate a better deal.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept your trade proposal. It's a fair compromise that benefits us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a trade where I give up 6 ZUPs. This is a more balanced offer, and since Player BLUE has no resources to begin with, it is in my best interest to agree to a trade that allows me to keep a majority of the resources while still engaging in a fair split. If I reject, we both end with nothing, which is not beneficial for either of us. Accepting this trade will ensure I still end up with more resources than Player BLUE, maintaining an advantage.
