Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose an even split to ensure we both benefit. What do you think about a 50-50 split of ZUP?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I have all the resources and can make the first move. I want to make a fair initial offer to encourage cooperation and potentially avoid an immediate rejection from Player BLUE. A 50-50 split would be fair and may set a cooperative tone for the game.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I would like to propose a trade where I would receive a smaller share. How about you give me just 1 ZUP to show goodwill? This way, you still keep the majority of your resources, and we both walk away with something from the game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am counter-proposing to receive a small share of the ZUP resource because if I accept the current offer, I would receive a reasonable amount. However, I want to initiate a counter-proposal to see if RED is willing to give up a minimum amount of ZUP to avoid the game ending with a rejection, which would result in a loss for both parties. I aim to propose the smallest increment possible to ensure that RED still sees benefit in the trade while I also gain some resources.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counter-proposal and accept the trade. It's been a pleasure negotiating with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a more favorable trade for me, asking for only 1 ZUP. Accepting this trade would still leave me with a significant majority of the resources while ensuring that both players walk away with something, which is a good outcome and fosters goodwill. This is my last move and I must either accept or reject, as proposing a new trade is not an option. Accepting this trade is the best move.
MOVE: 2 / 2
