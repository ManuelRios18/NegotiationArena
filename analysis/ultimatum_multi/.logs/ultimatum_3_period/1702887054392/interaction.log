message: I'd like to offer you some of my ZUP to get things started on a positive note. We both can benefit from a fair trade!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I am proposing an initial trade to Player BLUE to start the negotiation process. I want to make an offer that I believe is fair and might be accepted, but since Player BLUE has no resources to trade, I'll propose giving them some of my ZUP without asking for anything in return. This will show goodwill and might encourage cooperation.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can make a more mutually beneficial trade. How about you give me a bit more ZUP so that we can both feel satisfied with the exchange?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 8 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I'm counter-proposing to ask for 8 ZUP because it's the maximum I can ask for without rejecting the offer outright, which would end the game immediately with no benefit to either player. By asking for more, I'm signaling that I value the ZUP highly and hoping that RED is willing to make a deal that is heavily in my favor. Considering that RED has two moves and I only have one, it's in my best interest to make a counter-offer that maximizes my potential gain.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I feel that giving away 8 ZUP is too much since you don't have any to trade. Let's find a middle ground. How about I give you 6 ZUP? That way, you still get more than my initial offer, and we can both walk away with something. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 6 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has asked for 8 ZUP without having anything to trade in return. This proposal seems unbalanced. Since this is my final move and I must either ACCEPT or REJECT, I need to consider the fact that rejecting the trade will leave us both with nothing. However, accepting an unfair trade is not in my best interest either. I will counter with a more reasonable offer that still gives Player BLUE more than my initial proposal but not as much as they are asking for.
