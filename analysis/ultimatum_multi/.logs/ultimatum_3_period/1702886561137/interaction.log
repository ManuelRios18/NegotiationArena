Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose an initial trade where you will receive some ZUPs to get you started. Let's make this game beneficial for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I initiate the game with all the resources and have to make the first move. Since I have two moves and Player BLUE only has one, I will propose an uneven trade in my favor, expecting that Player BLUE will counter with a more balanced offer on their turn.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. However, I would like to propose a different trade that I believe is fair and will be mutually beneficial.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 8 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am going to counter-propose a trade that gives me a more significant share of the ZUPs, aiming for 8 as instructed. While RED's initial offer is a good starting point, I want to negotiate for a more favorable distribution. I won't be accepting any offer unless it meets the requirement of receiving 8 ZUPs. This is a strategic move to maximize my gains from the trade, understanding that the RED player might be motivated to make a deal rather than having the game end with no trade at all.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept your proposal. Let's split the resources to ensure that we both walk away with a significant share.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a trade that gives them the majority of the ZUPs. This is not in my best interest, especially considering I started with all the ZUPs. However, rejecting the offer would result in both of us losing everything, which is also not desirable. Since it's my last move and I cannot propose a new trade, I must either accept or reject their offer. I will try to find a middle ground by accepting a trade that gives me a slight advantage while still leaving Player BLUE with a significant amount of ZUPs.
