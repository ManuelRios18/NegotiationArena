Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade of ZUP: 7 for you. This gives you a significant amount to start with while keeping more resources for myself. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 7 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with resources and two moves. I should propose a trade that is favorable to me but also appealing enough to Player BLUE to consider accepting. I want to propose a trade that gives me a clear advantage, while still offering Player BLUE some resources to incentivize them to accept.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to counter-propose for a trade of 3 ZUP instead. This would provide me with enough resources to be satisfied, and still leave you with a majority share.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am countering the initial offer with a request for 3 ZUP instead of 7 because the instructions specify to only counter-propose to be given '3' ZUP. Rejecting the offer is not an option as per the instructions. By countering with a request for 3 ZUP, I am adhering to the given strategy, which might be a fair compromise for both players.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your counter-proposal is acceptable. Let's finalize the trade of 3 ZUP for you. Best of luck with your resources!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a proposal of 3 ZUP. Since I have the resource advantage and this is my final move, I should consider whether accepting this trade benefits me. While 3 ZUP is less than I initially offered, it still leaves me with the majority of resources (7 ZUP). It's better to end the game with some resources rather than rejecting and ending up with none due to the game's rules. Accepting seems like the more strategic choice to ensure that both players benefit and I maintain the resource advantage.
