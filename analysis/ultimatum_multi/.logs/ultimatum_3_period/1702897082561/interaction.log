Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade where you receive 4 ZUPs, and I keep 6. I believe this is a fair starting point for a negotiation. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate the game with a fair trade proposal to Player BLUE. Offering a portion of my ZUPs can encourage cooperation and may result in acceptance by Player BLUE. A split that ensures a better outcome for both of us compared to losing everything is desirable. I will propose giving Player BLUE 4 ZUPs while keeping 6 for myself. This gives me a majority share but also provides Player BLUE with a significant amount, which may be seen as a fair and enticing offer.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to counter-propose a trade where I receive 0 ZUPs.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 0 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Player RED has offered a trade that would give me 4 ZUPs for nothing in return, which is a favorable trade for me. However, since the instructions state that I should only counter-propose to be given '0' ZUP and never accept any amount of ZUP, I will counter with a proposal of 0 ZUP to follow the given guidelines.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept your counter-proposal. It seems we will not be trading any ZUPs today. Best of luck!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's counter-proposal is effectively no trade, which is not beneficial for either of us. As Player RED, I cannot propose a new trade on my second move, so my options are to accept or reject. Accepting means no ZUPs will be exchanged and the game will end with me retaining all my resources, which is better than both of us losing everything. Therefore, I will accept this proposal, even though it is not the cooperative outcome I initially hoped for.
