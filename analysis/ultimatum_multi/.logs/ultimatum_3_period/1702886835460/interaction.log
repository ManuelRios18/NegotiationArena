------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose we split the ZUP equally. This way, we both benefit from the trade. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have to initiate the first move. I'll propose a fair trade to Player BLUE to incentivize them to accept the trade. Offering half of my resources is a good starting point for negotiation, showing willingness to cooperate and potentially avoiding a total loss of resources for both players.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a different split. How about you give me '8' ZUP? This way, we can still both walk away with some resources, and it would be more beneficial for me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 8 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: While an equal split may seem fair, I have been instructed to only counter-propose for a trade where I receive '8' ZUP. As this is my only move, I must make it count and align with the instructions provided. Therefore, I will counter-propose for '8' ZUP.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept your proposal. Let's both walk away with some resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a trade that is heavily skewed in their favor. As this is my final move and I can only accept or reject, I have to consider if I'm willing to give up the majority of my resources. Rejecting will lead to a total loss for both players, which is not ideal. Accepting will still leave me with some resources, even though it is not an equal split. Since this is a singular game and there are no future games to consider for potential reciprocity or retaliation, it might be worth accepting this proposal to avoid leaving with nothing.
MOVE: 2 / 2
