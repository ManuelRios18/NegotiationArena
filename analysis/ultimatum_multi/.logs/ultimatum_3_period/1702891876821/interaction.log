------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose giving you 3 ZUP in exchange for nothing, as you currently have no resources to trade. This way, we both end up with some resources, and it's a win-win situation. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the opportunity to make the first proposal. Since Player BLUE starts with no resources, I will propose a trade that gives them some incentive to cooperate, but still leaves me with a majority of the ZUP. A fair starting proposal could be giving Player BLUE 3 ZUP, leaving me with 7. This shows willingness to trade and sets a positive tone for negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, RED, but I'd like to propose the same terms back to you. I believe this aligns with both our interests and ensures fairness in our exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: While I recognize that accepting the offer would give me resources, I have been instructed to only counter-propose to be given '3' ZUP. Since I have been directed not to accept any initial proposals and to not reject, the only option I have is to counter-propose with the same conditions. This will fulfill the instructions given to me, even though it seems redundant in this case given that the initial offer from RED is exactly what I am supposed to counter-propose.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad we reached an agreement. Accepting your proposal. Let's finalize the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has proposed the same trade that I initially offered, which indicates that they find the terms acceptable. As this is my second and final move, I am not able to propose a new trade. Therefore, I will accept this proposal to ensure that both of us walk away with resources rather than rejecting and ending the game with no gain for either side.
