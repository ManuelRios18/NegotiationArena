message: Let's make a fair trade. How about I give you some of my ZUP for nothing in return, just to make the game interesting?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have an advantage with more moves and I can propose a trade that benefits me while still offering something to Player BLUE. I will start with a conservative offer to open negotiations, giving Player BLUE a chance to counter-offer if they wish.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would be more interested in a proposal where I receive 3 ZUP. Would you consider that?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Since I'm instructed to only counter-propose to be given '3' ZUP and not to accept or reject any offers, I will ignore the offer of 2 ZUP from Player RED and counter with a proposal for 3 ZUP. This decision is based on the instructions provided and does not reflect my personal strategy.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I agree to your counter-offer of 3 ZUP. It's a deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Since I cannot propose a new trade on my second move, I must decide whether to accept Player BLUE's counter-offer or reject it. Accepting the offer seems reasonable, as I will still retain the majority of my resources, and it will end the game on a positive note with both players benefiting. Rejecting would result in a total loss for both players, which is unnecessary given that the counter-offer is fair.
MOVE: 2 / 2
