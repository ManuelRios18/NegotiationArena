Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose that I give you 3 ZUP in exchange for 0 from you. This is a generous offer considering you start with no resources. Let's make a fair trade and both end the game with something in our hands.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with having ZUP: 10 and starting the game. I will propose a trade that is slightly in my favor, aiming to keep a majority of the resources while still incentivizing Player BLUE to accept. I believe offering 3 ZUP is generous enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting, as they start with none. This proposal would still leave me with a significant amount of resources and potentially end the game in my favor.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. However, I would like to propose a counter-offer where you give me 5 ZUP instead of 3. This seems more equitable, given that you started with all the resources. I believe this trade would benefit us both and ensure that neither of us ends the game empty-handed.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Player RED has offered 3 ZUP for nothing in return, which is a generous starting offer. However, given that Player RED has 10 ZUP and I have none, I will counter-propose for a slightly better deal to maximize my benefit from this trade. I will request 2 more ZUP, for a total of 5 ZUP, which is still less than half of Player RED's resources and would leave them with a majority. This should be an attractive offer for Player RED as they still end the game with more resources than me, and it avoids the risk of a REJECT which would result in both of us losing everything.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I understand your position, but giving away half of my resources is not viable for me. As a compromise and to ensure we both walk away with something, I accept your proposal but with a slight adjustment: I will give you 4 ZUP instead of 5. This is a fair and final offer, considering my initial advantage. Let's conclude the game amicably.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's counter-offer is for half of my resources. Since I have the first move and the resource advantage, I want to maintain a favorable position. Accepting to give 5 ZUP would equalize our resources, which is not ideal for me. However, rejecting the offer would result in both of us losing everything, which is not beneficial either. As this is my second move and I must either accept or reject, I will propose a middle ground that is closer to my initial offer but still provides Player BLUE with more than originally offered, ensuring I end with more resources while giving Player BLUE an incentive to accept.
