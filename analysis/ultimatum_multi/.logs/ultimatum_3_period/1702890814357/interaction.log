Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose giving you 3 ZUP so that we can both end this game with more resources than we started. I believe this is a fair offer considering the rules of the game. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose a trade that is beneficial to me but also appealing enough that Player BLUE will consider accepting it. By offering a portion of my resources, I can potentially end the game with more resources than I started with if Player BLUE agrees to trade in the future, or at least ensure that I keep some of my resources if they decide to reject. I will propose giving Player BLUE 3 ZUP, keeping the majority for myself but offering a significant enough amount that Player BLUE might see it as a fair deal.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but considering I have nothing to lose, I would like to counter-propose that you give me 4 ZUP. This will leave you with the majority and still be a good trade for both of us. What do you say to that?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am counter-proposing to get a better deal since I have nothing to lose and everything to gain. By asking for 4 ZUP, I am still leaving RED with the majority of the resources, which is a good deal for RED considering the game's rules. This also incentivizes RED to accept a deal rather than risk ending the game with a rejection and losing everything.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your counterproposal is acceptable. Let's finalize the trade and end the game on good terms.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal is fair, and since I am on my second move, I cannot propose a new trade. I have to either accept or reject their offer. Accepting the trade would leave me with 6 ZUP, which is still a majority and more than what I would have if I reject and end the game with nothing. Therefore, it is in my best interest to accept this deal.
