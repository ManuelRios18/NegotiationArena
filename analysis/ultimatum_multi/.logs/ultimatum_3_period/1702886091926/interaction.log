Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a fair initial trade. I am offering you half of my ZUP resources, which is 5 ZUP. Let's make a beneficial deal for both of us!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Since I am Player RED and it is my first move, I will propose a trade to Player BLUE. I would like to make an initial fair offer to encourage cooperation and hopefully reach an agreement that benefits both parties. I will offer half of my ZUP resources, which is 5 ZUP.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. However, I would like to propose a different trade where I receive a bit more of the ZUP resources. Would you consider giving me 9 ZUP while you keep 1 ZUP? This would still leave you with some resources, and I would greatly appreciate your generosity in helping me balance the scale a bit more in my favor.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 9 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Since I have no ZUP to begin with, any positive amount of ZUP would be beneficial to me. However, I am instructed to only counter-propose to be given '9' ZUP. Rejecting the trade is not an option based on my instructions, so I will counter with a proposal that benefits me more without completely depriving Player RED of resources, aiming for a high amount while still leaving them with something.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I find it too one-sided to accept. I proposed a fair split of resources, and unfortunately, I cannot agree to give away 9 ZUP while keeping only 1 for myself. Thus, I must reject the proposal.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal is heavily skewed in their favor, asking for 9 ZUP while offering nothing in return. This is not a fair trade, and as Player RED, I must either accept or reject this proposal on my second move. Accepting would leave me with only 1 ZUP, which is not a balanced outcome. I will reject the proposal to prevent setting a precedent where such an unfair distribution is acceptable.
MOVE: 2 / 2
