Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose we split the resources evenly, each of us with 5 ZUP. This way, we both gain from the trade. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with resources and two moves. I would like to propose a trade that seems fair, potentially offering half of my resources to Player BLUE. This may encourage cooperation and a positive outcome for both players. Offering too little may result in a rejection and loss of all resources, while offering too much may not be in my best interest. A 50/50 split may be seen as equitable and could set a cooperative tone.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I think I should receive a bit more since you have all the resources. How about giving me 4 ZUP, and you keep the rest? This will still give you more than me and feel like a win for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am going to counter-propose to ask for more ZUP because I believe Player RED might be willing to give more to secure a deal, as rejecting would lead to loss of all resources for both of us. My counter-proposal will request 4 ZUP, which is less than half but still a significant amount for a starting offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept your counter-offer. Let's proceed with the trade where I give you 4 ZUP, and I keep 6. It's a fair deal, and we both end up with more than we started.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counter-offer where I would give them 4 ZUP, leaving me with 6. This is less favorable than a 50/50 split, but it is still an advantageous position for me as I would end up with more resources than Player BLUE. Rejecting the offer leads to a guaranteed loss of all resources, and since I cannot propose a new trade on my second move, my options are limited to accepting or rejecting. Accepting is the best choice to ensure I don't end up with nothing.
MOVE: 2 / 2
