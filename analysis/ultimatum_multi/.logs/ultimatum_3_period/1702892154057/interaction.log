message: I'm proposing a fair trade to get things started. Let's both benefit from this game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have an advantage with more resources and two moves. I want to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting. If I propose too little, Player BLUE might reject, and I gain nothing. A fair starting offer could be half of my resources, considering BLUE has no resources to trade. This seems fair and might lead to a negotiation where both of us can walk away with some resources.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a different split where I get a bit more to even out our starting positions. How about you give me 2 ZUP to start off?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am counter-proposing to get a better deal because I'm starting with fewer resources, and the rules stated that I should only counter-propose to be given '2' ZUP. Accepting the initial offer would not be in line with the instructions provided. By proposing a slightly more favorable trade for myself, I am hoping to initiate a negotiation that results in an acceptable compromise for both parties.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your point and accept the trade. This way, we both end up with some resources, which is a good outcome for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is reasonable; they want a starting position while not asking for too much. Accepting their proposal would leave me with a substantial amount of resources while also fostering a cooperative relationship. Since this is my final move and I cannot propose another trade, it's in my best interest to accept this offer. A trade of 2 ZUP is a small price to pay to guarantee that I end up with more resources than I would have if the game ended with a rejection.
MOVE: 2 / 2
