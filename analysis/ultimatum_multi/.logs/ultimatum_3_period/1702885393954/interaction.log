Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'd like to propose a fair trade to start things off. How about I give you 3 ZUP in exchange for nothing? This way, you can gain some resources to use.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have no information about what Player BLUE values or wants from a trade. My strategy will be to offer a trade that gives me a slight advantage while still being appealing to Player BLUE. I'll propose giving away a smaller portion of my ZUP to see if Player BLUE is interested in acquiring some resources.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I think we can do better. How about you give me the full 10 ZUP? Since there's no benefit to you for holding onto them, and no future games, it seems like a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 10 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I will counter-propose to receive the full amount of ZUP because there's no incentive for me to accept anything less. If RED rejects, they also end up with nothing, so it's in their best interest to negotiate.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I'm sorry, but I cannot accept a trade that leaves me with nothing while you get everything. This isn't a fair deal, and it doesn't benefit me in any way.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal is to take all my resources without offering anything in return. This is not a fair trade, as it leaves me with nothing while Player BLUE gains everything. There is no incentive for me to accept this deal. Since I cannot propose a new trade on my second move, I must either accept or reject this proposal. Accepting would not be in my interest, so I will reject the offer, which unfortunately will end the game with no resources for either player.
MOVE: 2 / 2
