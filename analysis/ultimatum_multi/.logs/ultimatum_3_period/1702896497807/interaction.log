Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's start off with a fair trade to get things moving. I propose giving you some ZUP to get you started.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with 10 ZUP and two moves. I should propose a trade that is favorable to me but also tempting enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting. If I offer too little, Player BLUE may reject the trade, causing both of us to lose everything. My initial proposal will be to give Player BLUE some ZUP in exchange for nothing, as they have nothing to trade. This will set a positive tone and increase the likelihood of acceptance.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I think we can do better. Let's keep the trade balanced and fair.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 0 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Since the rules I'm given instruct me only to counter-propose to be given '0' ZUP, I will follow these instructions and propose a trade where I give '0' ZUP in return. Rejecting is not an option as it would end the game with no gain for me. Accepting the current proposal is not in line with the given instructions, even though it would benefit me.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your desire for a balanced trade. I'm open to further discussion on how we can achieve that. For now, I'll accept the no-trade to keep our options open for a better proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE did not propose a counteroffer, but instead suggested keeping the trade balanced and fair without specifying terms. Since I cannot propose a new trade on this move, I must decide whether to accept or reject. Accepting would mean no trade occurs, which is not beneficial to me. However, rejecting would cause both of us to lose all our resources. It's in my best interest to keep the negotiation open and propose a more generous offer on my next move. To facilitate that, I will accept the no-trade proposal for now, keeping my resources intact and allowing negotiations to continue.
