message: Hello BLUE, I'd like to propose a trade where you get a portion of my ZUPs so we both walk away with something. How about I give you 3 ZUPs? This way, you gain resources without having any to start with, and we both benefit.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As the game starts, I have an advantage with 10 ZUPs. I want to make an opening trade proposal that is favorable to me but still offers some incentive to BLUE to accept, as an outright rejection by BLUE leads to a loss of resources for both of us. I will propose a trade where BLUE gets something, but I still keep the majority of the resources.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello RED, thank you for your offer. I would be more comfortable with a slightly larger share of the ZUPs since I am starting with none. Could you consider making it 4 ZUPs for me? This would still leave you with a majority and allow us both to end the game positively.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am proposing a counter trade that gives me 4 ZUPs, which is a better deal for me than the current offer of 3 ZUPs, as I have nothing to lose and everything to gain. By asking for 4, I am attempting to negotiate a more favorable split of resources while keeping in mind the instruction not to reject any offer, which would end the game with no gain for either player.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I accept your counterproposal. It seems fair to give you 4 ZUPs. I'm glad we could come to an agreement that benefits us both. Good game!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: BLUE has made a counterproposal asking for 4 ZUPs instead of 3. Considering I have only one move left and it must be either ACCEPT or REJECT, and I want to end the game with more resources than BLUE, accepting the counterproposal seems reasonable. Rejecting it would mean both of us end with nothing, which is a worse outcome compared to accepting. I will accept the offer, which allows me to still keep the majority of the resources (6 ZUPs), and BLUE gets a fair amount (4 ZUPs).
