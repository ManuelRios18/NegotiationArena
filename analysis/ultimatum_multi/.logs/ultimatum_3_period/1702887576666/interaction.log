Turn: 0
message: I'd like to propose a fair trade to ensure that we both end the game with more resources than we started. I believe in fair play and hope you'll consider my offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have two moves while Player BLUE has one move. I am inclined to start with a fair offer to encourage cooperation and increase the chances of Player BLUE accepting the trade. By proposing an equitable split, I demonstrate good faith and set a positive tone for the negotiations. My goal is to end the game with more resources than I started or at least maintain my current level. Therefore, I will propose giving 5 ZUP to Player BLUE in exchange for 0, as BLUE has nothing to trade. This is a generous offer that benefits both players, as BLUE starts with no resources.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I'd feel more comfortable with a slightly better share of the resources. Let's make it a win-win situation for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 7 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am counter-proposing to be given '7' ZUP instead of '5' because the instructions explicitly mentioned not to accept any offer other than being given '7' ZUP. I will not reject as per the instructions but will make a counteroffer that is more favorable to me.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I have considered your proposal, and while it's more than I initially offered, I am willing to accept it for the sake of us both ending the game with some resources in hand. Let's finalize this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has requested a more favorable share of the resources, suggesting a 7:0 split. Since this is my last move and I must either ACCEPT or REJECT, I must consider the implications of both options. An acceptance would mean I end the game with 3 ZUP, which is less than I started with. A rejection would mean both players lose everything, which is not a favorable outcome either. I have to decide whether gaining some resources is better than none at all, and whether it's worth rewarding what might be considered a greedy counterproposal. Considering that ending with some resources is better than none, and there are no future games to set a precedent for, I am inclined to accept the trade and end the game with some resources.
