Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose giving you 5 ZUP in exchange for nothing to balance the game and make it more interesting for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with resources. I aim to make a fair initial trade proposal to Player BLUE, hoping for an ACCEPT. This will avoid the game ending with both players losing everything, and it starts the negotiation on a positive note.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your generous offer. However, I'd like to propose a slight adjustment. How about you give me just 1 ZUP instead of 5? I believe this would be a more balanced approach for our game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I'm going to counter-propose to only receive 1 ZUP because those are the instructions I have been given. This is a non-standard approach to the game and doesn't align with typical game theory strategies where one would usually accept a favorable trade like the one proposed by Player RED. However, following the given instructions, I will counter-propose for less than what's offered.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I accept your counterproposal. It's a deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal is surprisingly modest, asking for only 1 ZUP. This is an advantageous trade for me, as it allows me to retain the majority of my resources while still engaging in a trade. I should accept this offer to ensure a positive outcome for myself and maintain goodwill. Rejecting such a favorable offer would be illogical and would only end the game with no benefit for either player.
