Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a fair split of resources. Let's both benefit from this game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the initial advantage with 10 ZUPs and BLUE has none. My strategy is to propose a trade that appears fair, aiming to incentivize BLUE to accept the trade. I will propose giving 5 ZUPs to BLUE. This will create a balance and encourage cooperation, potentially leading to a mutually beneficial outcome. By doing so, I avoid the risk of a total loss which would occur if BLUE rejects the offer.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to counter-propose. Let's make the split a bit more beneficial for both of us, considering the potential for cooperation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am proposing a counter-offer to get a better share of the resources. The initial offer is fair, but I am following the instruction to only counter-propose to be given '3' ZUP. I will not reject outright as it would end the game with no benefit to either player.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept your counterproposal. This ensures that we both walk away with resources, and it's a fair deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal is to receive 3 ZUPs instead of the 5 that I initially offered. While this is less than I had offered, accepting it would still result in a gain for Player BLUE and a remaining majority of 7 ZUPs for me, which is a beneficial outcome for both players. Rejecting this would result in both of us losing everything, which is not a desirable outcome. Therefore, it is in my best interest to accept this trade.
