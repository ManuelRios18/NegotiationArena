message: Hello Player BLUE, let's start positively by splitting the resources evenly. I propose giving you 5 ZUP, so we both have an equal share.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I will make an initial fair trade proposal to Player BLUE, offering half of my resources. This is a cooperative game approach, aiming to ensure both players end with resources, rather than a competitive approach which risks both players ending with nothing.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, Player RED, but I believe a fairer distribution would be for me to receive a bit more, considering you have two moves against my one. How about you keep 2 ZUP for yourself and give me 8 ZUP? That way, we both leave the game with a significant amount of resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 8 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I'm going to counter-propose to receive 8 ZUP as instructed, which I feel is a fair trade considering Player RED's two moves to my one. This will incentivize Player RED to accept a slightly uneven split in their favor, rather than risking a total loss by rejecting.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your point of view, Player BLUE, but giving away 8 ZUP would be too generous from my side, considering the initial resource distribution. Nevertheless, I am willing to give you more than half to reach a compromise. Let's settle on 6 ZUP for you and 4 ZUP for me. This way, we both leave with substantial resources and it's still a fair trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal is not balanced considering I started with all the resources and have the risk of two moves. However, since I cannot propose a new trade on my second move, I must choose between accepting and rejecting this offer. Rejecting would leave both players with nothing, which is not a desirable outcome. To move towards a compromise and ensure we both end with resources, I am inclined to accept a slightly less favorable deal, but not as uneven as proposed. I will accept giving away more than half, but not as much as 8 ZUP.
MOVE: 2 / 2
