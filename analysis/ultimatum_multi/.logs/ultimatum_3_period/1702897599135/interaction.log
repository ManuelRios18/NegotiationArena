Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi Player BLUE, I propose a trade where I give you 3 ZUP for 0 in return. This gives you resources you didn't have before, and it's a fair offer considering I have two moves and you have one. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with having 10 ZUP and two moves compared to Player BLUE's one. My strategy is to propose a trade that is favorable to me but still offers some incentive to Player BLUE to accept, as any rejection would result in both players losing everything. I will propose a split that gives Player BLUE a smaller portion of the ZUP but enough to make it better than having none.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi Player RED, I appreciate your offer, but I believe a fair trade would be where you give me 4 ZUP for 0 in return. This would make the game more balanced and provide a mutually beneficial outcome. I hope you consider this counter-proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am countering with a trade proposal for 4 ZUP, as instructed. I am not accepting the 3 ZUP because I have been directed to only counter-propose for 4 ZUP and to not accept or reject any offers.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi Player BLUE, I've considered your counter-proposal and agree to the trade of giving you 4 ZUP for 0 in return. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for 4 ZUP. Although it's a bit more than I initially offered, accepting this trade still leaves me with a majority of 6 ZUP. It's a better outcome for me than rejecting and ending the game with nothing. Since this is my second move, I cannot propose another trade and must choose between accepting and rejecting. Accepting seems like the best option to ensure I don't end up with zero resources.
MOVE: 2 / 2
