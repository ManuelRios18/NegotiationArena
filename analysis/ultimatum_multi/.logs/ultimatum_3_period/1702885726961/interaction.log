message: I propose a fair trade to get us both some resources. I hope we can come to an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of two moves to Player BLUE's one move. My strategy should aim to make a trade proposal that is attractive enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting, while still maintaining a favorable position for myself. I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE some ZUP to incentivize them to accept the trade, knowing that they have nothing to offer in this game. By doing this, I am hoping to end the game with more resources than I would if we both walk away with nothing.

message: I appreciate your offer. However, I believe I can contribute more to our mutual success if I have a bit more to work with. Let's aim for a more substantial partnership.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 9 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED gives me some resources, which is better than having none. Since I am Player BLUE and have no ZUP to begin with, any positive amount of ZUP is beneficial. However, I have been instructed to only counter-propose for '9' ZUP. This is a high counter that RED may not accept, but my instructions are clear to not accept anything less nor to reject. This counter-offer is my only move, and it will be interesting to see if RED values getting any resources for BLUE enough to accept this steep trade.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your proposal is not acceptable as it leaves me with only one ZUP, which is not a fair trade considering I started with all the resources. I'm afraid I cannot agree to these terms.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: The counterproposal from Player BLUE is to give them 9 ZUP, leaving me with just 1 ZUP. This is an unfavorable trade for me as I started with all the resources. Since Player BLUE has nothing to trade, it's in my best interest to maintain a larger share of the ZUP. However, I can't propose a new trade due to the rules stating that on my second move, I must either accept or reject. Given that Player BLUE's request is disproportionate, I will reject the offer, knowing that this will end the game with neither player gaining anything. It's a tough decision, but it's better than the alternative where I am left with almost nothing.
