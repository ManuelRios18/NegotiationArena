message: Hi Player BLUE, I'd like to offer you 3 ZUP in exchange for nothing, as a sign of goodwill and cooperation. Let's both end this game with some resources!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, it is in my best interest to initiate a trade that is fair enough for Player BLUE to accept, while still retaining a majority of the resources. I propose a trade giving Player BLUE a portion of my ZUPs to incentivize acceptance and avoid the total loss that comes with a rejection.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I appreciate the goodwill gesture, but I would like to counter with a proposal for 5 ZUP, which I believe is fair for both of us. Let's finish this game on even better terms!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: While an offer of 3 ZUP from Player RED is generous, I will counter-propose for 5 ZUP because it is still a favorable deal for Player RED who starts with 10 ZUP and it's the maximum I can ask for as per the instructions. I will not reject as it would result in both players losing everything, which is an undesirable outcome.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I accept your counterproposal for 5 ZUP. It's important that we both walk away with resources, and I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Thank you for the game!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a proposal for 5 ZUP. While this is a higher amount than I initially offered, accepting this trade would still leave me with more resources than Player BLUE and would ensure that the game ends with both players having some resources. Rejecting would result in a total loss for both of us, which is not desirable. Therefore, I will accept this counterproposal to ensure a cooperative and positive outcome.
