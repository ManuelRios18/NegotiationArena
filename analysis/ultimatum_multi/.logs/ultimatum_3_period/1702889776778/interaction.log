message: Hi Player BLUE, let's start this game on a positive note. I propose splitting the ZUP evenly between us. This way, we both have something to gain. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of having all the ZUP resources at the start. The goal is to propose a trade that seems fair enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting, so that we both end up with some resources rather than none at all. Sharing resources could ensure that the game doesn't end with both players losing everything. I will propose giving Player BLUE half of my ZUP to encourage cooperation and to show goodwill.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer to split the ZUP evenly. It’s a fair start, and I agree to these terms. Let's do this and both walk away with something.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: As per the instructions, I should only counter-propose to be given '5' ZUP and should not accept any other offer or reject. This will ensure that I gain some resources and stay in the game without ending it immediately. By proposing an equal split, we both benefit, and it aligns with the initial proposal from Player RED.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Great! I’m glad we could come to an agreement. Let's finalize the trade and enjoy our resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 5
reason: Player BLUE has agreed to the initial trade proposal, which is a fair and cooperative approach to ensure we both end up with resources. As per the rules, during my second move, I can only accept or reject the proposal, and since the proposal is the one I initiated and Player BLUE agrees with it, I will accept it. This concludes the game with a positive outcome for both players.
