Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'd like to propose a fair trade where you also get some ZUP. How about I give you 4 ZUP? This way, we can both end this game with more than what we started with, considering you started with none.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I am proposing a trade that gives Player BLUE some of my ZUP in exchange for nothing, as they have nothing to trade. This is to ensure I get a better outcome than losing all my resources by a potential REJECT from Player BLUE. The offer will be less than half of my resources to maintain a better position.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I would like to counter-propose. I believe a split where I receive a more significant portion would be fair given that you have all the resources to begin with. How about you give me 9 ZUP? This way, you still keep more than me and we both leave the game with something substantial.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 9 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am countering with a trade that gives me 9 ZUP because the initial proposal is not the most advantageous for me, and I want to negotiate for a better deal. Rejecting is not an option as it would end the game with no benefit to either player, and my goal is to gain some resources. Since Player RED has 2 moves, they might be willing to give up more resources in the second move to avoid a total loss if I reject their final proposal.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I'm sorry, but I cannot accept your counter-proposal as it leaves me with less than what I would consider fair. I propose we end the game.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has counter-proposed an unfair trade where they get the majority of my resources. Since this is my last move and I cannot propose a new trade, the best course of action is to reject this offer. Accepting would not be to my benefit, and proposing is not an option. I will reject the offer to maintain my resources, even though this ends the game with no gain for Player BLUE.
