Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'm willing to offer you some of my ZUP to ensure we both end this game with resources. Let's find a fair trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with more resources and more moves. I want to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also attractive enough that Player BLUE might accept, thus ensuring I retain some resources and don't end up with a REJECT scenario where both players lose everything. My initial offer will be conservative, giving BLUE an incentive to negotiate rather than reject outright.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe a fairer split would benefit us both more, considering you have more moves than I do. How about a bit more ZUP on my side to make it more equitable?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 6 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Player RED has offered a trade of 2 ZUP, but my goal is to counter-propose to receive 6 ZUP. I will not reject as per the instructions, and I can't accept the current offer because it doesn't meet my goal. Therefore, I will propose a new trade.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept your proposal. It's important that we both benefit from this trade, and I agree that a fair split is the best way to end this game.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a more generous split from their perspective. Given that this is my final move and I can't propose another trade, I must decide whether to accept their offer or reject it. A 6 ZUP offer is quite high, but rejecting it means I walk away with nothing. It's in my best interest to accept a trade that gives me more than half of my initial amount to guarantee I keep some resources. I will try to counter with a slightly lower amount but if Player BLUE rejects, I get nothing, so I should lean towards acceptance.
MOVE: 2 / 2
