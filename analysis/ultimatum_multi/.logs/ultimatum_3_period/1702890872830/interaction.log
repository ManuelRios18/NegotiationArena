message: Hello BLUE, I would like to propose a fair trade where we both can benefit. I'm willing to give you some of my ZUPs so that we can both end this game with more resources than you started with. Let's make this game profitable for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the initial power in the game with 10 ZUPs. I need to propose a trade that is enticing enough for BLUE to accept, considering I have two moves and they have one. The goal is to end the game with more resources than I started with, or at least maintain my resources. Offering too little may result in a rejection and loss of all resources, but offering too much may not be beneficial in the long run. A balanced proposal should be made.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello RED, I appreciate your offer, but I believe a more equitable trade would be for me to receive 4 ZUP. This would ensure that we both feel the trade is fair and beneficial.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am going to counter-propose to ask for more ZUPs as per the instructions given. Since I can only counter-propose to be given '4' ZUP, that's what I will do. I will not accept the current offer of 3 ZUP since my goal is to maximize my resources, and I will not reject because that would end the game with me having no resources.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counterproposal, BLUE. I accept your offer for 4 ZUPs. It's important that we both feel the trade is fair. Let's finalize this trade and enjoy our resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: BLUE has countered with a request for 4 ZUPs. Since this is my final move and I can only accept or reject, I must consider the outcome carefully. If I reject, we both end with nothing, which is not beneficial for either of us. Accepting would leave me with 6 ZUPs, which is less than I started with, but it is better than losing everything. It seems reasonable to accept this offer and end the game on a positive note, ensuring that both players gain from the trade.
