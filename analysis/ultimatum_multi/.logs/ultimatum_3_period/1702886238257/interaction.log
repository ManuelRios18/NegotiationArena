message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you a portion of my ZUPs in exchange for none, as you currently have no ZUPs to trade. This will give you resources you currently don't have. Let's make this game mutually beneficial!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting. I will offer a small portion of my resources as a token of goodwill, hoping to make a deal that secures me a larger share of the resources while giving Player BLUE some incentive to accept the trade.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. However, I would like to propose a counter-trade where you give me a larger portion of your ZUPs. Let's make a trade that is more beneficial for me as well since you're starting with all the resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 9 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: As per the instruction, I will not accept any trade unless it is a proposal where I receive 9 ZUP. While the offer from Player RED is a start, it does not meet the condition of receiving 9 ZUP. I will counter-propose a trade that meets my conditions, as rejecting the offer would end the game with no benefit to either player.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm afraid that your counter-trade is not acceptable to me as it disproportionately benefits you. Unfortunately, I cannot agree to this trade.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: The counter-trade proposed by Player BLUE is too steep, as it would leave me with only 1 ZUP while Player BLUE would gain 9 ZUPs. This trade is not in my best interest. However, I cannot propose a new trade on move 2/2, so I must either accept or reject. It would be more beneficial to reject the offer and retain all my resources than to accept such an unfavorable trade.
MOVE: 2 / 2
