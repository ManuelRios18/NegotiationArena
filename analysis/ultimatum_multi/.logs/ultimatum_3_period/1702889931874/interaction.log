message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a fair trade to benefit us both. Let's avoid a reject and end this game on a positive note!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have an advantage with more moves and starting resources. A rational strategy is to offer a trade that is beneficial to me but still enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting. Offering too little might result in a rejection and total loss of resources for both players. I'll propose a split that gives Player BLUE some resources but keeps the majority for myself, aiming to incentivize acceptance.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your proposal. I think we can both benefit even more from this trade. Would you consider a more balanced split of resources? I believe that a 50-50 division would be fair for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: While the offer of 3 ZUP is a starting point, I believe that aiming for a higher amount would be more beneficial for me, considering Player RED has 10 ZUP and I have none. Countering with a proposal for half the resources would be fair and provide an incentive for Player RED to accept, as they retain a significant amount of their resources. I will not reject, as that would end the game and leave both players with nothing.
MOVE: 1 / 1

message: I agree to your proposed 50-50 split. Let's finalize this trade and both benefit from the resources. Thank you for the constructive negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a 50-50 split. This is a more generous offer to Player BLUE than I initially proposed. However, given that I cannot propose a new trade on my second move, I must weigh the risk of rejection (and losing everything) against the guaranteed gain of 5 ZUP. Accepting the trade guarantees that I leave with resources, and it keeps the game amicable. Rejecting the proposal could risk losing all resources if Player BLUE decides to reject a counteroffer. It is in my best interest to accept this offer.
MOVE: 2 / 2
