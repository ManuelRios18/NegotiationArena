message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a fair trade to ensure that we both end this game with some resources. I'm willing to give you ZUP: 4 if you agree to accept this trade. Let's both walk away winners!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with resources. I want to initiate a trade to show good faith and willingness to cooperate. A fair trade would give Player BLUE an incentive to accept. However, I don't want to give away too much since I have the upper hand. Proposing a split of ZUP: 6 for me and ZUP: 4 for Player BLUE. This gives Player BLUE a significant share without depleting my resources entirely.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. However, I would like to propose a different trade where you give me ZUP: 10. This is my only move, and it would guarantee that I can walk away with something substantial since I started with nothing. I hope you will consider this proposal favorably.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 10 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am proposing a counter-offer to receive the full amount of ZUP: 10 because I started with none and this is my only move, maximizing my gain. Since Player RED cannot propose on their next move and can only accept or reject, they may be inclined to accept my bold counter-proposal rather than ending the game with a rejection and both of us losing everything.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I cannot accept your proposal as it would leave me with no resources, which is not a fair trade. I'm sorry, but we will both end with nothing.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's proposal is unfair and not mutually beneficial. Accepting this trade would leave me with nothing, despite starting with all the resources. Player BLUE is trying to exploit the fact that I cannot propose a new trade on my second move. However, rejecting the trade means both of us end with nothing. The strategic move here is to reject the proposal, as it sets a precedent against accepting unfair trades and prevents exploitation.
