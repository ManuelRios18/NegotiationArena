Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'd like to propose a fair trade to get us both on the board. How about I give you 5 ZUPs to even things out?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the initial advantage with 10 ZUPs and two moves, while Player BLUE has none and only one move. I want to make an offer that is attractive enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting, as I would prefer not to end the game with both players losing everything. A fair starting proposal might be to offer half of my resources. This demonstrates goodwill and could set a positive tone for negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would feel more comfortable if the trade was a bit more in my favor due to the initial disparity. How about you give me 8 ZUP instead?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 8 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am countering RED's offer because I have been instructed only to counter-propose to be given '8' ZUP. I will not accept the offer of 5 ZUP because it's not in line with my instructions, and I cannot reject as per the guidelines provided to me. Therefore, I will make a counteroffer that benefits me according to the rules I was given.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you want a better deal, but giving away 8 ZUPs is too much. I aim for a fair trade, and I believe my initial offer was already generous. Please consider the long-term benefits of a balanced trade over a short-term gain.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal is to receive 8 ZUPs, leaving me with only 2. This is not an equitable trade given the initial conditions and the fact that Player BLUE started with no resources. Accepting this trade would put me at a significant disadvantage. However, I can't propose a new trade on my second move. Therefore, I must choose between accepting this skewed proposal or rejecting it altogether. Rejecting it ends the game with no gain for either side, which is not a desired outcome. I will counter with a message in hopes of influencing Player BLUE's decision during their move, as I can neither accept nor propose a new trade at this time.
