message: Hello BLUE, I'd like to propose a trade where I give you some ZUP so we can both walk away with something. How about I give you 3 ZUP to start off?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with more resources and more moves. I would like to propose a fair trade to Player BLUE to ensure that we both can end the game with some resources, rather than rejecting and ending up with nothing. Proposing a trade where I still keep the majority of ZUP since BLUE has no resources to trade.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, RED, but I think I would be content with just 1 ZUP. It's still a win for both of us and allows you to keep more of your resources. How does that sound?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I'm counter-proposing to receive 1 ZUP because any positive amount would be beneficial to me, and it's in RED's interest to agree to avoid both of us ending with nothing. Rejecting is not an option as it would end the game with no gain for either player. By proposing a trade for a smaller amount, I'm signaling that I'm willing to cooperate and conclude the game quickly, which RED might find appealing since they stand to lose less and finalize the trade.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your reasonable counteroffer, BLUE. I'm happy to accept this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has suggested they would be content with only 1 ZUP. This is a better outcome for me as it allows me to retain more resources. Since this is my final move and I can only accept or reject, I will accept this proposal to ensure that the game ends positively for both of us without risking rejection and losing everything.
MOVE: 2 / 2
