message: Hi BLUE, I'd like to propose a fair split of resources to ensure we both benefit. Let's avoid rejecting and losing everything. What do you think about splitting the ZUP evenly?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I am in a position to propose a fair trade to Player BLUE to incentivize them to accept. Offering a split that appears equitable could lead to a successful trade, keeping in mind that if Player BLUE rejects, we both lose everything. I will propose a trade of 5 ZUP to make it an attractive offer.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I appreciate your offer to share the ZUPs. I'd feel more comfortable with a trade that gives me at least a small share of the resources, considering the current disparity. How about you keep the majority and just give me 1 ZUP? This way, we both walk away with something.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Since I currently have no ZUPs and RED has offered a split, I should counter-propose to receive some ZUPs to ensure I gain from the trade. I will counter-propose to receive 1 ZUP, because this is the only counter-offer I can make according to the conditions given, and it is a better outcome for me than receiving none.
MOVE: 1/1

Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I accept your proposal. It's a fair deal and I'm glad we could come to an agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counter-offer where they are asking for only 1 ZUP. This is an even better outcome for me as I get to keep the majority of the ZUPs. There is no benefit to rejecting this offer, as doing so would result in both of us losing all resources. Accepting this trade is the best course of action.
