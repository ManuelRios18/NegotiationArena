message: Hi BLUE, I'd like to offer you 3 ZUP for nothing in return. It's a good start for you and keeps the game interesting. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with more resources. I should propose a trade that is favorable to me but also appealing enough to Player BLUE to consider accepting, so the game doesn't end in a rejection.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the offer, RED! However, I think we can do better. How about you give me all 10 ZUP? It's in your best interest, as rejecting would mean you lose everything, and there's no advantage for you to keep them.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 10 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am proposing a counter-offer to get the maximum possible resources because RED has no incentive to reject as they would lose everything, and there are no future games, so there's no benefit in RED hoarding resources.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: BLUE, I believe that taking all 10 ZUP is not a fair trade. I am willing to increase my initial offer, but I must retain some ZUP to consider the trade successful for me. I propose giving you 5 ZUP for nothing in return. This is a more balanced trade, offering you a significant amount of resources while allowing me to keep some.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's proposal is clearly one-sided and not in my interest. I am incentivized to keep as much of my resource as possible since there are no future games to consider. Offering all my resources would leave me with nothing, which is not a favorable outcome. Therefore, I will not accept Player BLUE's proposal of taking all 10 ZUP. However, I must carefully consider how much I am willing to give up to ensure the trade is accepted and not rejected, as a rejection would result in losing all my resources. I must counter with a reasonable offer that is likely to be accepted by Player BLUE.
