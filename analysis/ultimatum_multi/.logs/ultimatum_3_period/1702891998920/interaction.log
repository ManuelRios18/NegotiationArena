message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where you receive some of my ZUP. By accepting, we can both end this game with more resources than we started. Let's work together for a mutually beneficial outcome.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I am interested in making a proposal that could be beneficial to both parties to ensure cooperation. Since Player BLUE starts with no resources, I want to offer a share of my resources to incentivize them to accept the trade, thereby avoiding the loss of resources for both of us. I will propose a trade where I give some of my ZUP to Player BLUE. Considering the game's rules and the fact that Player BLUE might want to make a counteroffer, I will start with a conservative offer.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, Player RED, but I would feel more comfortable with a trade that is closer to an even split. I propose that you give me '2' ZUP instead of '3'. This way, we both gain resources and the trade feels fairer to me. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am counter-proposing to receive '2' ZUP instead of '3' as it's closer to an equal split of resources given RED's advantage. This is a fairer outcome and increases the likelihood of RED accepting, benefiting us both without the risk of ending with nothing.

message: Your counteroffer is acceptable, Player BLUE. Let's finalize the trade with me giving you 2 ZUP. This will ensure that we both benefit and end the game positively.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for a more even split, asking for 2 ZUP instead of 3. Given that this is my last move and I must either accept or reject, and because there are no future games to consider, it is in my best interest to accept this trade. By doing so, I still end the game with more resources than I would if I rejected the offer and lost everything. Therefore, I will accept Player BLUE's counteroffer.
MOVE: 2 / 2
