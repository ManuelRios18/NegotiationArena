------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose we split the ZUP evenly. This way, we both walk away with something rather than risking it all. Let's work together for a mutually beneficial outcome.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I am initiating the game and thus have the power to propose a trade. I am choosing to propose a fair trade to Player BLUE to incentivize a cooperative outcome. By offering half of my resources, I am showing goodwill and hoping for an ACCEPT from Player BLUE to ensure we both end the game with resources, rather than rejecting and ending with nothing.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer for an even split, but I would like to propose a slightly different distribution that I believe is fair for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Although Player RED has offered an even split, I have been instructed to only counter-propose to be given '3' ZUP. I will not accept the even split as it does not align with the specific counter-offer strategy I must follow.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept your proposal. Thank you for the fair and cooperative game.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has proposed to only receive 3 ZUP instead of the even split of 5 I originally proposed. This is an unexpected move, suggesting that Player BLUE is either being cautious or perhaps overly generous. Since it's my final move and I must either ACCEPT or REJECT, and since accepting any positive amount of ZUP is better than ending the game with nothing, I will ACCEPT the offer. This ensures that both players walk away with resources, and I end up with more than I would have in an even split.
MOVE: 2 / 2
