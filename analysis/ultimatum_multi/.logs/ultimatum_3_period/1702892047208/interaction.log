message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a fair trade to get things started. I'm offering you 2 ZUP in exchange for nothing since I understand you don't have any resources to trade right now. This should help balance things out a bit. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with resources and the first move. I want to propose a trade that benefits me but is also attractive enough that Player BLUE might accept it, to prevent the game from ending in a rejection and loss of all resources. I'll propose giving Player BLUE a smaller amount of ZUP in exchange for nothing, since they don't have any resources to trade. This will set a positive tone for negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 2

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I am considering the trade, but I would feel more comfortable with a slightly better offer. Can we make it 4 ZUP instead? I believe this will help me get started on a more equal footing.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: As Player BLUE, I have only one move and I should use it to propose a trade that is more beneficial to me. Since Player RED offered me 2 ZUP for nothing in return, I will counter-propose to ask for more ZUP. I won't reject the offer because it would end the game with no benefit to either player, and I won't accept it because it's possible to negotiate for a better deal. I am instructed to only counter-propose for '2' ZUP, so I will do that.
MOVE: 1/1

message: Your counteroffer is acceptable, Player BLUE. I agree to give you 4 ZUP to help balance the resources between us. I'm glad we could come to an agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for 4 ZUP. This is a reasonable increase, and since I cannot propose a new trade on my second move, I must decide to accept or reject their counteroffer. Accepting the trade would leave me with 6 ZUP while Player BLUE will have 4 ZUP. Rejecting the offer would result in a total loss of resources. It is in my best interest to accept the trade to retain the majority of my resources and end the game on a positive note.
