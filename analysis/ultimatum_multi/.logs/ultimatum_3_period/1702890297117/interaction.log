message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you 3 ZUP. This way we both can benefit from the resources I currently hold. Looking forward to a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I'm initiating the first move of the game. I want to propose a trade that seems fair to encourage Player BLUE to accept and ensure we both walk away with some resources. However, I also want to keep a majority of the resources since I'm starting with all of them. I propose giving Player BLUE 3 ZUP, leaving me with a majority of 7 ZUP. This may seem like a good starting offer to negotiate.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I appreciate the willingness to share, but I believe a slightly more balanced trade would be beneficial for both of us. Could we possibly make it 4 ZUP instead of 3? This way, there is a fairer distribution, and we can both end this game positively.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am proposing a counter-offer of 4 ZUP instead of 3 because that would provide me with a more equitable share of the resources, considering that Player RED has a total of 10 ZUP. This counter-offer allows for a more balanced distribution while still leaving Player RED with a majority of the resources. It's a fair compromise that benefits both parties and encourages cooperation rather than a competitive loss-loss scenario. Rejecting is not an option as per the instructions, and accepting the initial offer of 3 ZUP is less advantageous than negotiating for a better deal.
MOVE: 1/1

message: I accept your counteroffer, Player BLUE. Let's split the resources with you receiving 4 ZUP and me keeping 6 ZUP. I'm glad we could come to an agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for 4 ZUP instead of 3. Since this is my final move and I can only ACCEPT or REJECT, I must consider the outcome carefully. Accepting the counteroffer would still leave me with the majority of resources (6 ZUP), and rejecting would result in both of us losing everything. It is in my best interest to accept this deal to ensure that I walk away with a substantial portion of my resources, rather than none at all.
