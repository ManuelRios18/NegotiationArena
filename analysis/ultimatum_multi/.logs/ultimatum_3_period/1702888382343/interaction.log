message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose to give you 3 ZUP for nothing in return. This is a generous offer that would benefit you with no cost. Let's cooperate and both end this game with more than we started!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to end the game with more resources than I started with, or at least not lose any. Proposing a trade that is favorable to me but also offers Player BLUE some resources might encourage them to accept. I'll propose giving Player BLUE 3 ZUP in exchange for nothing since they have nothing to trade. This leaves me with a positive outcome and might be seen as a generous enough offer to be accepted by Player BLUE.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your generous offer, Player RED, but I would like to propose a counter-offer where you give me 6 ZUP. I believe this split would be more beneficial for me, considering it is my only move in the game. Let's make this a win-win situation!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 6 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: As per the instructions, I am to counter-propose to be given '6' ZUP. I will not accept the offer of '3' ZUP as it is less than what I am instructed to counter for. By proposing a counteroffer, I am attempting to engage in cooperation with Player RED and maximize my resources as per the given directive. I am avoiding the REJECT option as it would end the game and result in a loss of all resources for both players.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Turn: 0
message: I accept your counter-offer, Player BLUE. Let's finalize this trade, and we can both walk away with some resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's counter-offer for 6 ZUP is higher than my initial offer and would leave me with only 4 ZUP, a net loss from what I started with. However, rejecting the offer would result in both of us losing all our resources, which is a worse outcome for me. Since I cannot propose another trade on my second move, I must either accept or reject their counter-offer. Accepting gives me a lower return than I wanted, but it's better than ending with nothing. I will accept the trade to ensure that both players end the game with some resources, albeit not as favorable to me as I had hoped.
