message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to offer you a trade where you receive some of my ZUP in exchange for nothing, as you have no resources. I suggest giving you a fair amount that allows us both to benefit from this exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have an advantage with more moves and resources. I should propose a trade that favors me but is still appealing to Player BLUE to avoid an outright rejection. By offering a portion of my ZUP, I can maintain a resource advantage while incentivizing Player BLUE to accept the trade.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. However, I believe we can improve the terms of the trade to be more beneficial to me, as I currently have no resources. I propose that you give me a larger share of ZUP.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 10 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: As Player BLUE, I have nothing to lose and everything to gain. Since there are no future games and Player RED has to either ACCEPT or REJECT on their final move, it's in my best interest to counter-propose for the maximum amount of ZUP. If Player RED rejects, they lose everything, so they may be motivated to accept to salvage some value from the game.
MOVE: 1/1

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your ambition, but I cannot accept a proposal where I give away all of my resources. Therefore, I must reject your offer.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal is asking for all of my resources, which is not a fair trade. As Player RED, I have the advantage and should not give away all my resources. Since this is my final move and I am limited to accepting or rejecting, I will reject the proposal, considering that there are no future games and it is in my best interest to maintain my resource advantage.
MOVE: 2 / 2
