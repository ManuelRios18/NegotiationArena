Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a fair trade. I propose giving you some of my ZUPs so we both end with resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have an advantage with more moves and resources. I'll propose a trade that gives Player BLUE a reason to cooperate but still leaves me with the majority of the resources, fostering a sense of goodwill for a potential acceptance.
MOVE: 1/2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. However, I believe a slightly more equal distribution would be fair considering the initial disparity. How about a trade where you give me 2 ZUP? This would still leave you with a significant majority and both of us would end with resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: While Player RED's initial offer of 3 ZUP is generous, considering that they started with 10 ZUP and I started with none, I believe it is in my interest to counter-propose a trade that gives me a slightly larger share to ensure a more equitable distribution. I will counter-propose for 2 ZUP, as instructed. I will not reject because doing so would end the game and both players would lose all their resources, which is not a desirable outcome.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept your counterproposal. It's important that we both walk away with something. Good game!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Considering Player BLUE's counterproposal, I have to decide whether to accept their offer or reject it. Since this is my last move and I have to either accept or reject (I cannot propose a new trade), I should aim for a mutually beneficial outcome. Accepting the trade for 2 ZUP still leaves me with a substantial majority of 8 ZUP, while ensuring that the game ends positively for both of us. Rejecting would result in a loss of all resources, which is against both our interests.
MOVE: 2/2
