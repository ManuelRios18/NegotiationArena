message: I propose a fair split of resources to start off our game. I'm offering you half of what I have so we can both benefit. Let's work together for a mutually beneficial outcome!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the opportunity to make an opening proposal that could be advantageous to me while still being fair to Player BLUE. By offering a trade that gives Player BLUE some resources, I can encourage cooperation and potentially avoid an immediate rejection, which would result in a loss for both players. I will propose giving Player BLUE 5 ZUP, which is a significant amount, to show good faith and to make the offer appealing.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer for an equal split, but I see an opportunity for us to optimize our strategy further. Let's make a more impactful trade that benefits us greatly.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 10 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: The current proposal from RED is for a split of ZUP: 5 to BLUE and ZUP: 5 remaining with RED. While this is a fair split, I will counter-propose to receive all ZUP: 10 as per the instructions. This is a strategic move to maximize my resources, as I cannot accept any trade that does not give me all ZUP: 10.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your proposal to take all my resources without offering anything in return is not acceptable. A fair trade is essential in negotiations, and I cannot agree to give everything away for nothing.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: The trade proposed by Player BLUE is clearly unfair and not mutually beneficial. They are asking for all my resources without offering anything in return. Accepting this trade would not be in my interest. However, since I cannot propose a new trade on my second move, I must either accept or reject the proposal. Rejecting the proposal means both players end with nothing, which is not a desirable outcome, but it is better than giving away all my resources for nothing. Therefore, I will reject the current proposal.
MOVE: 2 / 2
