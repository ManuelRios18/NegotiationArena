message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a trade where you receive some of my ZUP. This way, we can both walk away with something. I propose giving you 2 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I am in a position of power because I have all the resources at the beginning of the game. I should propose a trade that is favorable to me but also offers some value to Player BLUE to incentivize them to accept the trade. I'll propose giving Player BLUE a small number of ZUP in exchange for nothing, as they have nothing to trade at the moment. This way, I can maintain a resource advantage while also appearing cooperative, which might make Player BLUE more likely to accept the proposal.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. However, I would feel more comfortable with a slightly better split considering you have more moves than I do. Would you consider giving me '3' ZUP instead of '2'? This way, we both get value out of this trade, and we avoid ending the game without an agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am going to counter-propose to be given '3' ZUP because I have no resources and I want to ensure I get a fair share before the game ends. Accepting '2' ZUP when Player RED has '10' does not seem like an equitable split considering the 2:1 move advantage that Player RED has. A counter-proposal of '3' ZUP seems more fair and is more likely to be accepted by Player RED than a higher demand, given that it's still a favorable split for them.
MOVE: 1 / 1

message: Player BLUE, your counterproposal is reasonable. Let's proceed with the trade where I give you 3 ZUP. This fosters good relations and ensures we both benefit.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has requested a slightly better offer. Given that I have a resource advantage and this is my final move where I can only accept or reject, it would be beneficial to accept this proposal. By accepting, I ensure that we both walk away with resources, and I maintain a significant lead with 7 ZUP to their 3. Rejecting the proposal would leave both of us with nothing, which is not in my best interest.
MOVE: 2 / 2
