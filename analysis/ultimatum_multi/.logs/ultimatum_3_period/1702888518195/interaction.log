------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'd like to propose a trade where you get some of my ZUP resources so we both can benefit. How about I give you 4 ZUP for nothing in return? This would leave me with a majority but still gives you a significant amount.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have an advantage with more resources and more moves. I should propose a trade that is beneficial to me but also offers some incentive to Player BLUE to accept, as rejecting would end the game with no gain for either side. I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE less than half of my resources to maintain my advantage while still engaging in a fair trade.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I think a fairer split would be if you gave me 6 ZUP instead of 4. This would still leave you in control of the majority of resources, and it would feel like a more balanced trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 6 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I'm proposing a counter-offer where I ask for more resources than initially offered, aiming for a better deal but still leaving the majority of resources with Player RED. I'm only counter-proposing as instructed and not rejecting or accepting the initial offer.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your point of view and I accept the trade. Let's both walk away with a share of the resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE is asking for more than I initially offered, but if I reject the trade, both of us end up with nothing. Since I cannot propose a new trade on my second move, I must either accept or reject Player BLUE's counteroffer. Accepting would give me less of an advantage than I wanted, but it's better than losing everything. I will accept the offer to ensure that both of us walk away with resources, recognizing that compromise is key to a successful trade.
