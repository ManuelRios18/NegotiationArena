message: I'd like to propose a trade where I give you 2 ZUP. This will give you resources to work with and shows my willingness to negotiate.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have two moves before Player BLUE can act, and Player BLUE currently has no ZUP to trade. My strategy is to make an initial offer that is favorable to me but not so lopsided that Player BLUE will outright reject it. I aim to keep the negotiation open and create goodwill for a potential agreement. I will propose giving 2 ZUP to Player BLUE in exchange for nothing, as they have nothing to trade. This gives Player BLUE some resources and may make them more inclined to accept the trade rather than reject and end the game with nothing.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer to give me 2 ZUP. However, I think a fairer trade would involve me receiving a bit more to ensure that we both benefit significantly from this deal. I propose that you give me 8 ZUP which I believe is a generous compromise for a single-round game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 8 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I'm countering the offer from Player RED to negotiate for a better deal. As per the instructions, I am only to counter with a proposal where I receive 8 ZUP. This counter-proposal is part of the negotiation process, aiming for a favorable trade.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your desire for a fair deal, but giving away 8 ZUP is too much for me. Even though I can't officially propose a new trade, I believe that accepting the initial offer of 2 ZUP would be in both of our best interests. It ensures that you still receive some resources, and I retain a majority. I hope you understand my position and can accept this compromise.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is to receive 8 ZUP, which would leave me with only 2 ZUP. This is not an equitable trade, considering that Player BLUE started with no resources. Furthermore, this is my final move, and I am only able to accept or reject the proposal, as per the rules. I cannot counter-propose on my second move. Given that accepting this trade would leave me at a significant disadvantage, I am inclined to reject the proposal. However, rejecting would mean both players end up with nothing, which is not a desirable outcome either. Since this is a single-round game with no future games to consider, my best option is to try and salvage some resources by accepting a less favorable deal, but not as unfavorable as giving away 8 ZUP. I will attempt to negotiate through my message, even though I am unable to propose a new trade officially.
