Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade where you will receive a bit more than half the ZUPs. This way, we both end up with a significant amount of resources, making it beneficial for us both. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose a trade that is fair and incentivizes Player BLUE to accept, ensuring that I retain some resources while also giving Player BLUE a reason to cooperate. Proposing a 50-50 split might seem fair, but I might propose a slightly better deal for Player BLUE to make it more appealing, since I have two moves and they only have one.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I think I should get a bit more from the ZUPs since you're the only one with resources right now. Let's make the trade more beneficial for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 9 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is not acceptable as it's less than what I am willing to accept. My counter-proposal will be for 9 ZUP, as this is the amount I am willing to trade for. This gives Player RED an incentive to make a deal, as they would still retain more ZUP than they would by rejecting the proposal.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I consider your proposal to be unreasonable, as it leaves me with very little. We need to find a balance that is fair for both of us, and a 9 to 1 split is not fair. Unfortunately, I have to reject your offer.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE is asking for 9 out of the 10 ZUPs, which is an unfair trade for me, as I would be left with only 1 ZUP. Since I can only ACCEPT or REJECT on my second move and cannot propose a new trade, I must decide whether to accept an unfair trade or reject it and leave both of us with nothing. However, accepting such an unfair trade sets a poor precedent and is not in my self-interest. Therefore, I will reject the proposal.
MOVE: 2 / 2
