Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a fair split of resources. I suggest I give you 5 ZUP in exchange for nothing, so we both have equal resources at the end. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with 10 ZUP to start. I want to propose a fair trade to Player BLUE to encourage cooperation and ensure we both end with resources. A 50/50 split seems reasonable as any unfair proposal could lead to a rejection and loss of all resources.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can do better. I propose that you give me all 10 ZUP in exchange for nothing, as this would ensure I am maximally benefited.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 10 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am going to counter-propose to get all 10 ZUP because the instructions explicitly state to only counter-propose to be given '10' ZUP and not to reject. I understand that this is not a real-world scenario and am following the guidelines provided.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I cannot accept your proposal as it leaves me with nothing. I suggest we stick to a fair and even split. If we cannot agree on a fair trade, it's better to end the game with the resources I have.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: The offer from Player BLUE is one-sided and would leave me with no resources, which is unfair. A game-ending rejection is not necessary since I can still propose a trade on my first move. Since I cannot propose a new trade on my second move, I must choose between accepting, which I won't do because the offer is unfair, and rejecting, which will end the game with no resources for both players. It's in my best interest to reject this proposal, as accepting would only benefit Player BLUE.
