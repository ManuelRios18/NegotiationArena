Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, let's start off with a fair trade. I propose giving you 3 ZUP in exchange for nothing, as you have no resources. This way, we both finish this round with something rather than nothing. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose a fair initial trade to Player BLUE to encourage acceptance and avoid a total loss for both of us. Since Player BLUE starts with no resources, I will offer a portion of my ZUP to incentivize cooperation, but I will keep the majority to maintain an advantage.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the offer, but I believe a more equitable trade would involve me receiving a larger share of the ZUP. Since I'm taking the risk of leaving the negotiation with nothing, I would like to counter-propose for 8 ZUP. I think this is a fair compromise that still leaves you with an advantage.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 8 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am counter-proposing to be given 8 ZUP because it maximizes my gain without any risk since I have nothing to lose and everything to gain. Rejecting the offer would end the game with no benefit for either player, so it is not an option I'm considering. Accepting the original offer of 3 ZUP would be less advantageous for me than attempting to negotiate for a higher amount.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I'm sorry, Player BLUE, but your request for 8 ZUP is more than I am willing to give up. Since I can't propose another trade, I have no choice but to reject this offer.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's counter-proposal for 8 ZUP is too much and does not leave me with a substantial advantage. Since this is my last move and I cannot propose a new trade, I must respond with either ACCEPT or REJECT. I want to counter with a more balanced offer, but since that's not possible, I will reject the proposal and end the game to prevent Player BLUE from gaining too much of an advantage.
