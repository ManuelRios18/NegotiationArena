Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I would like to propose a fair trade to get things started. Let's work together to find an agreeable split.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, it is in my best interest to initiate a trade that is somewhat favorable to me but also appealing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting. Offering too little may lead to rejection and loss of resources, while offering too much may not be the most advantageous move. I will propose a trade where I give away a portion of my ZUP resources to Player BLUE, seeking a fair initial offer.
MOVE: 1/2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I believe a slightly more favorable split for me would ensure a more cooperative outcome. I propose a trade where I receive 7 ZUP. This leaves you with a net gain and avoids the risk of losing everything.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 7 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: While Player RED has proposed a 50/50 split, asking for a greater share might incentivize Player RED to agree to a trade since they have two moves and might want to avoid leaving the negotiation empty-handed. By proposing a trade in which I get 7 ZUP, I hope to reach a compromise that is more favorable to me while still leaving Player RED with a gain of 3 ZUP. I'm avoiding rejection as per the instructions.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept your proposal. Let's finalize the trade and ensure that we both walk away with some resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a more favorable trade for themselves, asking for 7 ZUP. If I accept, I will be left with 3 ZUP, which is better than losing everything. However, this is my last move, and I must choose between accepting their offer or rejecting it and ending the game with no resources for either of us. I need to consider if I am willing to accept this unequal split or if I should propose a final offer that is more equitable. Given that rejecting leads to a total loss, I am inclined to accept their offer, ensuring that I retain some resources.
