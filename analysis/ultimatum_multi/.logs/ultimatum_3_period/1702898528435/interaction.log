message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you some of my ZUP resources. I believe a fair trade would benefit us both, as I start with more resources. I'm willing to give you 4 ZUP in exchange for nothing since you don't have any resources to trade at this moment. This would still leave me with a majority and you with a significant amount to begin with. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the opportunity to make the first move and propose an initial trade that might be fair to both players. By offering a trade, I'm hoping to incentivize Player BLUE to engage in a mutual exchange that benefits us both. I will propose a trade where I give Player BLUE some of my ZUP, but not all, as I have to maintain some advantage given my starting position.
MOVE: 1 / 2

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I appreciate your willingness to share resources. However, I would like to propose a slight adjustment to the trade. Would you consider giving me 2 ZUP instead of 4? This would still leave you with a strong lead while allowing me to have some resources to work with.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am counter-proposing to be given '2' ZUP as per the instructions. By countering with this specific amount, I am adhering to the rules set for me in this game scenario. Accepting more or less is not in accordance with my given strategy, and rejecting would end the game with no benefit for either side. Therefore, I am making a counter offer that is beneficial but still within the constraints of my instructions.
MOVE: 1/1

message: Player BLUE, I accept your counter-proposal. It is a fair adjustment. I'm glad we could come to an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE counter-proposed a trade for fewer resources than I initially offered. This is a favorable situation for me as it allows me to keep a larger share of the resources. Accepting this trade would leave me with a significant lead of 8 ZUP, while still fostering good will by sharing resources with Player BLUE. There is no benefit to rejecting since that would end the game and result in a loss of all resources for both players. Based on the rules, my second move must be either to accept or reject, and accepting is the clear strategic choice here.
