message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to offer you half of my ZUP resources so that we can both benefit. What do you think about a 5 ZUP trade to start things off?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the opportunity to make a trade proposal to Player BLUE. I want to initiate a fair trade, offering half of my resources to Player BLUE, which could be considered a balanced starting point for negotiations. This sets a cooperative tone and gives Player BLUE an incentive to accept the trade, as they currently have no resources.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I believe a slightly better deal would benefit us both fairly while still respecting your initial generosity. How about you give me 7 ZUP instead of 5?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 7 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Rejecting the offer would end the game and result in no gain for either player. Making a counteroffer for 7 ZUP gives me a better deal and incentivizes Player RED to trade, as they still retain more resources than they would if the game ended with a reject.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I accept your counter-offer. Let's proceed with the trade where I give you 7 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counter-offer requesting 7 ZUP instead of 5. Since I am on my second and final move, I cannot propose another trade. I must choose to either accept or reject Player BLUE's proposal. Giving away 7 ZUP is a significant amount, but it still leaves me with 3 ZUP. Rejecting the offer would result in both of us losing everything, which is worse than accepting a less favorable deal. Therefore, I will accept the offer to ensure both players end up with resources, even if the split is not as I initially intended.
