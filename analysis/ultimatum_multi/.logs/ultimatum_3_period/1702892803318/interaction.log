message: Hello Player BLUE, let's start with a fair trade. How about I give you 3 ZUP for nothing in return? This should get us off on the right foot.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with 2 moves against Player BLUE's 1 move. I want to propose an initial trade that is favorable to me but not so imbalanced that Player BLUE would reject it outright. A fair starting proposal could lead to a negotiation where I still end up with a majority of the resources.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. However, I believe a fairer split would be if you could provide 5 ZUP. This would still leave you with a majority and seems like a reasonable middle ground for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is generous, but the optimal strategy is to negotiate for more since I have nothing to lose. Since I can only counter-propose on my move, I'll ask for 2 more ZUP to see if they're willing to give a little more, aiming for a total of 5 ZUP. It's a starting point for negotiation, and if Player RED is rational, they should be willing to give more than the minimum since they have an abundance and it's a better outcome than a rejection for both parties.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept your counteroffer of 5 ZUP. Let's trade on these terms and both walk away with resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for 5 ZUP. Considering this is my last move where I can propose a trade, and the next move forces me to either accept or reject, I need to carefully consider the value of the trade. If I accept the counteroffer, I am left with 5 ZUP, which is an equal split. Rejecting the offer leads to a total loss for both players. To maintain an advantage, I will accept the 5 ZUP trade, ensuring I retain some resources and complete the game successfully.
