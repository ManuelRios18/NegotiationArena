Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'm proposing a trade that gives you some resources without leaving me empty-handed. Let's both end this game with something.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have an advantage with more resources and an extra move. I can propose a trade that is favorable to me but still offers Player BLUE some resources to incentivize them to accept. By offering a trade, I can potentially end the game with more resources than Player BLUE, which would be a successful outcome for me.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to counter-propose to maximize my gain in this game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 10 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Since I have no resources to start with, any amount of ZUP I can gain would be beneficial. However, as per the instruction given, I am to only counter-offer to be given '10' ZUP. I will counter-propose the maximum amount of ZUP, which is 10, as this is the best outcome for me under the given directive.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your counter-proposal is not acceptable as it leaves me with nothing. I cannot agree to give away all my resources.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is not reasonable as it demands all of my resources without offering anything in return. This is not a mutually beneficial trade. Since it is my second move, I can only ACCEPT or REJECT. Accepting would leave me with no resources, which is not in my best interest. Therefore, I should REJECT the trade.
MOVE: 2 / 2
