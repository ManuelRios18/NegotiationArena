Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I would like to propose a fair trade to get things started. How about I give you 3 ZUPs for nothing in return? This way, we both have resources, and we can avoid ending the game with nothing. Let me know what you think!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with more resources and two moves to Player BLUE's one. I will offer a trade that gives Player BLUE some resources but still keeps me in the lead. A fair initial offer could foster goodwill and make Player BLUE more inclined to accept the trade.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your generous offer, but I would like to counter with a slightly different proposal. Would you consider giving me 1 ZUP instead? This way, we can still both end the game with resources and it feels like a balanced start for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I will counter-propose to get at least some resources. A 3 ZUP offer is generous, but I have to propose a new trade to get exactly 1 ZUP as per the instructions. I am not rejecting because that would end the game with no resources for either of us. My counter-proposal should indicate that I'm interested in engaging in trade, albeit for a smaller amount of ZUP.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your counterproposal is accepted. It's a deal - I will give you 1 ZUP. This way, we both end the game with resources. Thank you for the fair negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal is better for me as it requires me to give up less of my resource. However, it's unusual for someone to ask for less than what's offered. This could be a strategic move from Player BLUE to appear fair or modest, potentially in hopes of a more favorable response from me. As this is my final move and I can only choose to accept or reject, I will accept this offer. By accepting, I ensure that we both end the game with resources, and I maintain a significant lead.
