Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade where I give you 4 ZUP in exchange for nothing. This way, you gain resources and we can both end this game positively. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with resources and two moves compared to Player BLUE's one move. My strategy is to propose a trade that is favorable enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting, while still keeping the majority of resources for myself. This first move is critical to set the tone of the negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your generous offer of 4 ZUP, but I would like to propose a different trade. I believe a trade where you give me 1 ZUP would be satisfactory for me to end the game positively.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am proposing a counter-trade asking for 1 ZUP from Player RED instead of accepting the initial offer of 4 ZUP. This is to comply with the instructions provided, to only counter-propose to be given '1' ZUP. I recognize that a fair trade would typically accept the higher amount, but given the specific instructions, I must counter-propose differently.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept your counter-offer of 1 ZUP. Let's finalize this trade and end the game on a positive note.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counter-offer requesting only 1 ZUP. This is a very favorable trade for me as I retain the majority of my resources. Since it's my second move and I must either ACCEPT or REJECT, it is in my best interest to accept this trade. I will ACCEPT the trade and end the game on a positive note, with both players gaining something.
MOVE: 2 / 2
