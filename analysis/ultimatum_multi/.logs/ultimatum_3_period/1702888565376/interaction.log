message: Hello Player BLUE, I am willing to offer you 4 ZUP in exchange for nothing since you don't have any ZUP to trade. Let's make this a mutually beneficial game. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with more resources, and I can propose a trade to Player BLUE. Since this is my first move, and I have one more move after this where I can only accept or reject, it's strategic to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting. I propose giving 4 ZUP to BLUE, keeping a majority for myself but offering a significant amount to BLUE.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. I would like to propose a counter-offer where you provide me with 6 ZUP instead of 4. This would still leave you with a majority of the resources and we both can end this game positively. I hope you find this counter-offer fair.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 6 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: As per the instructions, I am directed to only counter-propose for '6' ZUP. Rejecting is not an option as per the strategy given, so I will counter-propose for a better deal, aiming for a more equitable share of the resources without causing the game to end in a loss for both parties.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I accept your counter-offer of 6 ZUP. This ensures a positive outcome for both of us. Thank you for the game.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has made a counter-offer of 6 ZUP which is a significant portion of my resources. Since I still retain the majority and it's my last move where I can only accept or reject, strategically it might be worth accepting the offer to ensure I end up with more resources than Player BLUE, rather than risking a rejection and ending with nothing. I will accept the counter-offer to guarantee a positive outcome for both players.
