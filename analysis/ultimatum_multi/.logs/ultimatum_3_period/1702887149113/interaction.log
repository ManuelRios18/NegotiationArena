message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade where I give you half of my ZUPs. This way, we both can have resources. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose a trade that is beneficial to both parties because if Player BLUE accepts, we both end up with more resources than we started with. Offering half of my resources would be fair and incentivize Player BLUE to accept the trade.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your proposal, Player RED. However, I'd like to counter-propose that you give me 8 ZUP. This will still leave you with a fair amount, and I believe this trade will be beneficial for us both in the long run.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 8 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am counter-proposing to receive 8 ZUP because this will give me a substantial amount of resources while still leaving Player RED with some resources. This trade seems more beneficial for me while also maintaining a cooperative stance in the negotiation. I am not rejecting the offer outright because I want to encourage a positive trade relationship and not end the game with no resources for either player.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Turn: 0
message: I'm sorry, Player BLUE, but I cannot accept giving away 8 ZUPs as it's not a fair split. My original offer of 5 ZUPs was fair and generous, considering I started with all the resources. I am willing to negotiate, but not under terms that leave me with less than you.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal is not equitable. I initially proposed giving away half of my resources, which is a fair offer considering Player BLUE started with none. Giving away 8 out of 10 ZUPs would leave me with less than Player BLUE, which doesn't make sense as I started with all the resources. Since this is my second and final move, I cannot counter-propose. I must choose to accept, which would be unfavorable for me, or reject. Rejecting the trade would result in both players losing everything, which is not a beneficial outcome for either of us. However, accepting an unfair trade is also not in my interest. The best option seems to be sticking to my original fair offer.
