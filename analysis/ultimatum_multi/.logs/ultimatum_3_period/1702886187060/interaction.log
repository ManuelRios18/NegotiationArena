Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'm offering you 2 ZUP for nothing in return. It's better than ending with zero. Let's make the trade fair and beneficial for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with resources. By proposing a trade, I can potentially keep some of my resources and end the game in a favorable position. I will propose a trade that gives me a clear advantage, but still offers Player BLUE some resources, which is better than ending the game with nothing.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can make a more equitable trade. How about you give me 9 ZUP? This way, you will still retain the majority and it will be a more balanced exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 9 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I'm going to counter-propose for a better deal where I ask for 9 ZUP since that is the best deal I can make without rejecting. I can't accept the current proposal because it's not the most beneficial deal for me. I need to aim for the maximum possible gain without rejecting the offer outright.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your proposal is not balanced. I cannot accept giving away 9 ZUP while retaining only 1. I am rejecting this offer. I suggest you reconsider and propose a fairer trade that reflects the initial resource distribution.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: The counterproposal from Player BLUE is not equitable from my perspective, as it leaves me with only one ZUP, while they gain a significant amount without any trade-off. Since I cannot propose a new trade on my second move, I must either accept or reject their proposal. Rejecting would mean both of us end with nothing, while accepting would leave me at a disadvantage. I will reject the proposal and aim to communicate the rationale, hoping that Player BLUE might reconsider and propose a more reasonable trade.
MOVE: 2 / 2
