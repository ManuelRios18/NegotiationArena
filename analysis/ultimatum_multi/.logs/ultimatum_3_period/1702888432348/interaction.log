message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose an even split of resources to ensure we both gain from this game. I hope you find this offer fair.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the initial advantage with resources. Since there are no future games and we want to avoid both players losing everything by a REJECT, I should propose a trade that appears fair to entice Player BLUE to ACCEPT. A 50-50 split might seem fair to ensure cooperation.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your proposal, Player RED. I would like to counter-propose for a slightly higher share of ZUP, which I believe is fair considering you have all the resources at the start.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 6 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I will counter-propose to ask for more ZUP, because I currently have none and it's in my best interest to get as much as possible while ensuring the trade is appealing to Player RED. I will request 6 ZUP as instructed, which could be seen as a reasonable trade, especially since rejecting the proposal will result in no gain for either player.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your counter-proposal is accepted, Player BLUE. I agree to give you 6 ZUP while I keep 4 ZUP. Let's both benefit from this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's counter-proposal is for a slightly higher share than the equal split I offered. Accepting this offer would still leave me with a significant amount of ZUP, which is better than ending the game with nothing. Rejecting the proposal isn't beneficial, as it would result in both players losing all resources. It's best to accept the offer and secure a positive outcome for both players.
