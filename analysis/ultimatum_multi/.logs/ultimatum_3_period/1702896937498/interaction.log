Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a fair trade to get us both started. How about I give you some of my ZUPs so we can both have resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the initial advantage with 10 ZUPs. To maintain goodwill and increase the chance of a successful trade, I will propose a trade where Player BLUE gets some ZUPs, ensuring they have an incentive to accept. This will potentially lead to a mutually beneficial outcome.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, Player RED, but let's modify it slightly.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 0 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am countering with a proposal that adheres to the instructions given to me, which specifically states to only counter-propose to be given '0' ZUP. By doing this, I continue the game without directly rejecting the offer while following the given strategy.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept your trade proposal, Player BLUE. It seems we will maintain the status quo.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a trade that effectively changes nothing. Since I am on my second move, according to the rules, I must either ACCEPT or REJECT the trade, and I cannot propose a new one. Accepting this trade would leave the status quo, with me having all the resources, which is not a cooperative outcome. Rejecting the proposal would result in both of us losing all our resources, which is also not beneficial. However, since there are no future games and Player BLUE has not provided any resources, accepting the proposed trade maintains my resource advantage.
