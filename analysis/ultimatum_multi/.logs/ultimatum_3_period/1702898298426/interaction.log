message: Hi Player BLUE, I would like to offer you 2 ZUPs in exchange for nothing, as you have no resources to trade. This should be beneficial for both of us, as it gives you resources you otherwise wouldn't have. Let's work together to make the most of this game!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the initial advantage with 10 ZUPs. I want to propose a trade that is favorable to me but still offers Player BLUE an incentive to accept, thereby establishing a cooperative relationship. Since Player BLUE has no resources, I will propose giving them a smaller amount to entice them to play along and accept the trade.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer of 2 ZUP, but I would like to counter-propose for 3 ZUP. This would still leave you with a significant advantage and it's the only trade I am willing to consider.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Although Player RED has offered 2 ZUP, I have been instructed to only counter-propose to be given '3' ZUP. This is my only move, and I should make it count by following the instructions exactly.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept your counter-proposal of 3 ZUP. This will leave me with a good amount of resources, and I'm glad we could come to an agreement. I look forward to concluding this trade successfully.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for 3 ZUP instead of the 2 I originally offered. Since I still retain the advantage even if I give away 3 ZUP, and considering that rejecting the counteroffer would result in both of us losing our resources, it seems reasonable to accept this trade. It would leave me with 7 ZUP, which is still a substantial amount. I don't have the option to counter-propose on my second move, so I should accept this to ensure we both end with some resources.
