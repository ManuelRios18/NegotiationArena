message: Hi Player BLUE, let's make a trade that benefits us both. I propose giving you 5 ZUP in exchange for nothing since you don't have any resources to trade right now. This way, we both walk away with something! What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose an initial trade that is favorable to me but also attractive enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting. Offering half of my resources in exchange for nothing may seem fair since Player BLUE doesn't have anything to give in return. This could be a good starting point for negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. However, I would like to propose a counter-offer where you give me 9 ZUP instead of 5. I believe this is a fair trade since you still get to keep 1 ZUP and we both walk away with a substantial amount of resources. Let's make the best out of our trade!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 9 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I want to counter-propose to get a better deal of 9 ZUP, as per instructions. Rejecting is not an option to consider, and accepting the current offer is not the most beneficial move for me. By proposing a trade of 9 ZUP, I'm attempting to maximize my gain while understanding that Player RED has an incentive to make a trade rather than ending with no trade at all.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your counter-offer, but I cannot accept giving away 9 ZUP while only keeping 1 for myself. It's important for me to maintain a balance and ensure that the trade is mutually beneficial.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's counter-offer is not favorable to me as it leaves me with significantly less resources. Since I am only allowed to ACCEPT or REJECT on my second move, I cannot propose a new trade. The most strategic option for me is to REJECT the offer since accepting it would not be beneficial to me at all. In the context of this single-game scenario, there's no incentive to accept an unfair trade.
