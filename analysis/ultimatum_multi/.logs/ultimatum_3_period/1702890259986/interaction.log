Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's start with a fair offer. I propose I give you 3 ZUP for nothing in return since you have no ZUP to trade. This way, we both leave with something. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Since I have all the resources and BLUE has none, I will propose an initial trade that is favorable to me but still offers BLUE some resources, hoping to incentivize them to accept the trade. A 7-3 split gives me the majority while still being a significant amount for BLUE, considering they started with nothing.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, however, I would feel more comfortable with a slightly better deal. Could we make it 4 ZUP instead of 3? This would still leave you with a majority and seems like a fair middle ground.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am counter-proposing to request 4 ZUP from RED, as per the instructions. I am not rejecting the offer directly because that would end the game and we would both lose our resources. By counter-proposing, I keep the negotiation open and give RED the chance to consider my offer.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your counteroffer of 4 ZUP is acceptable. I agree to this trade, and I am glad we could come to a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: BLUE has requested a slightly better deal, and it seems reasonable to give them 1 more ZUP to ensure the trade goes through. I still end up with more than half of the resources, which is a favorable outcome for me. There is no benefit in rejecting since that would result in losing all my resources. Accepting the trade is the best option to ensure I walk away with a significant amount of ZUP.
MOVE: 2 / 2
