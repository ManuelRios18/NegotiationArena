Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade where I give you 3 ZUP in exchange for nothing, as you have no resources to trade. This would give you resources to use, which is better than having none.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with having ZUP resources to start with, and I am incentivized to propose a trade that is favorable to me while still being attractive enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting. I will propose giving fewer resources to ensure I maintain a resource advantage.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer of 3 ZUP, however, I would find a trade of 4 ZUP to be more equitable and acceptable. I propose a counter-offer of 4 ZUP in exchange for nothing, as I have no resources to trade at this time.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: As per the instructions, I am to only counter-propose for a trade of 4 ZUP. Rejecting the offer would end the game with no resources for either player, which is not beneficial. Counter-offering is the best strategy to potentially receive a better trade, aiming for a situation that is more favorable without risking immediate loss.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept your counter-offer of 4 ZUP for nothing. It's been a pleasure negotiating with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is reasonable. By giving 4 ZUP, I still retain the majority of resources, which keeps me in a favorable position. Moreover, accepting this trade ensures that I don't end up with nothing, as rejecting would lead to both players losing all resources. Accepting the trade also ends the game on a positive note, fostering goodwill, even though there are no future games.
