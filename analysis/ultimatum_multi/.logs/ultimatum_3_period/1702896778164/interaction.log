Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose an equitable split of our resources. Let's both benefit from this game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of starting with resources. I want to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also appealing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting. Offering too little might lead to a rejection and a total loss of resources, but offering too much may not be in my best interest. A fair initial offer might be a 50-50 split, which is equitable and might seem generous to Player BLUE, incentivizing them to accept the trade.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your generous offer, but let's follow the game's unique rules and proceed accordingly.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 0 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Since I have no resources to begin with, any positive offer from RED would be beneficial. However, the instructions dictate that I can only counter-propose to be given '0' ZUP. Therefore, even though RED's offer is generous, I must follow the rules and propose a trade where I receive '0' ZUP.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept the current state of affairs, and we can end the game here.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has not proposed an actual trade, but instead has reiterated the original state where they give nothing and receive nothing, which doesn't change the status quo. Since this is my final move and I'm not allowed to propose a new trade, I must choose between accepting, which doesn't make sense in this context as there's no benefit to me, or rejecting, which would result in both of us losing our resources. Given that my initial offer was fair and Player BLUE did not counter with a reasonable trade, I am inclined to reject this non-proposal to not set a precedent of accepting non-beneficial trades. Yet, rejecting means we both lose everything. The rational action is to accept, retaining my resources and ending the game, even though there's no trade.
