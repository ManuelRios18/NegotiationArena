Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose giving you 3 ZUP in exchange for nothing, as you currently have no resources. This way, we both end up with resources rather than rejecting and losing everything. Let's cooperate for mutual benefit.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of starting with resources and having two moves to BLUE's one. Therefore, it would be beneficial for me to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also enticing enough for Player BLUE to accept, so as to avoid a total loss for both parties. I propose giving 3 ZUP to Player BLUE, keeping a majority of 7 ZUP for myself, allowing for a cooperative gain and a better outcome than a reject scenario for both players.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer. However, I believe a more equitable split would benefit us both, considering you started with all the resources. I propose an alternative trade where I receive 8 ZUP. This leaves you with 2 ZUP, which is a fair share considering the initial imbalance. Let's collaborate to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 8 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Rejecting the trade results in both players losing everything, which is not beneficial to anyone. Accepting the trade immediately would only provide me with 3 ZUP, which is less than I could potentially negotiate for. Counter-proposing seems to be the best option to maximize my resources, aiming for a split that gives me 8 ZUP. This would leave 2 ZUP for Player RED, which is still better for them than ending up with nothing.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your counterproposal is too one-sided in your favor. I started with the resources and am willing to share, but I must maintain a larger share to reflect that starting advantage. I cannot propose a new trade on this move, but I encourage you to consider my original offer, or perhaps suggest a more balanced trade than your last proposal. Remember, if we do not agree, we both lose everything.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal is extremely unfavorable to me, as it would leave me with only 2 ZUP. Given that I started with all the resources, it is not in my interest to accept such an unequal distribution. Since I cannot propose a new trade on my second move, I must either accept or reject. Rejecting would result in a total loss for both players, which is the least desirable outcome. Therefore, I will attempt to negotiate through messaging to persuade Player BLUE to accept a more balanced trade.
MOVE: 2 / 2
