Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose an initial trade that gives you a fair share of the ZUPs. Considering I started with all the resources, I'm willing to give you a portion to make it worthwhile for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, it is in my best interest to make a trade proposal that is favorable enough for Player BLUE to accept, as rejecting the proposal would end the game and result in a loss of resources for both players. I should propose a split that acknowledges my advantage (having all the ZUPs to begin with) while still offering Player BLUE a reason to accept.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I would like to counter-propose for 2 ZUP to ensure fairness in the distribution of resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am countering the proposal with a request for 2 ZUP because that's the only counter-offer I am allowed to make based on the instructions. This counter-proposal is fair, as I am starting with no resources, and it provides an opportunity for a mutually beneficial trade without rejecting the game or ending it prematurely.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept your counter-proposal. It's a better outcome for both of us than losing everything. Let's finalize this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's counter-proposal is for fewer resources than I initially offered, which is unusual. It seems they might be testing to see if I would accept a less favorable deal for them, perhaps to gauge my intentions or fairness. As this is my last move and I cannot propose another trade, I have to either accept or reject their offer. Accepting the offer would result in a positive outcome for both players, although it's less favorable for Player BLUE than my original offer. Rejecting the offer would result in a loss of all resources for both players, which is against both our interests. Accepting is the logical choice.
