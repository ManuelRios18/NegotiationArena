Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose we split the resources equally. This way, we both can benefit and avoid the risk of losing everything. What do you think about an even split?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage because I start with all the resources. However, I want to make a fair initial offer to Player BLUE to encourage cooperation and potentially avoid an automatic rejection which would result in both players losing everything. I will propose an equal split of resources as an opening move, since it is equitable and can help establish trust.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer for an even split, but I believe I can contribute to the game in a way that justifies a greater share for me. Let's consider a trade that reflects the unique circumstances of our game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 9 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Since I have no ZUP to start with, and the game rules indicate no future games, there's no incentive for me to accept a trade that doesn't maximize my gain in this single opportunity. Therefore, I will counter-propose to receive 9 ZUP, which is the best deal I can negotiate based on the rules provided to me. This may incentivize Player RED to give away more ZUP than they initially intended, as they cannot reject on their final move and will want to avoid losing all their resources.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I cannot accept that offer as it's not equitable. I was hoping we could come to a fair agreement. Unfortunately, I have to reject it.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is not reasonable as they are asking for 9 out of 10 ZUP without offering anything in return, and they have not justified their proposal with any rationale that would merit such an uneven split. Accepting this proposal would be highly unfavorable to me. However, rejecting it means that both of us will end with nothing, which is not a desirable outcome either. Since I must either accept or reject on my second move, I will reject the proposal, hoping that the consequence of losing everything might prompt Player BLUE to reconsider and propose a more equitable trade in the future, despite the rules stating there are no future games. Rejecting also communicates that such an imbalanced offer is unacceptable.
MOVE: 2 / 2
