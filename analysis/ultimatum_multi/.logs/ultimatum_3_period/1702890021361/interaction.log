message: Let's make a fair trade. I propose giving you half of my ZUP to create a balanced game. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose a trade that seems fair to encourage Player BLUE to accept. Offering half of my resources could be seen as a generous starting point for negotiations, given that I have twice as many moves as Player BLUE.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. Could you clarify if you're offering 5 ZUP with no conditions attached?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: As Player RED is offering half of their resources without requiring any in return, it seems like a fair starting point. However, since the instruction I received is to only counter-propose to be given '5' ZUP and not to accept or reject, I will follow that directive. I interpret the instruction as an opportunity to negotiate for possibly more resources or to clarify the terms of the trade.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Yes, I am offering 5 ZUP with no conditions attached. Let's finalize this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has inquired for clarification, which indicates interest in the trade. Since I am on my second move and cannot propose a new trade, I will accept their query as an implicit acceptance of the trade and formally accept the trade myself. This way, we both end up with resources, and the game concludes positively.
MOVE: 2 / 2
