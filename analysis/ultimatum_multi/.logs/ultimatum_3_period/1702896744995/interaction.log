Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose an equitable trade. I'm offering you 5 ZUP in exchange for nothing, as you have no ZUP to trade. This way, we can both end this game with resources. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the opportunity to propose an initial trade. I want to propose a fair trade to Player BLUE to incentivize them to accept, as rejecting would result in both of us losing everything. I will offer half of my ZUP, which is 5, to make the trade attractive for Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your generous offer. However, I'd like to propose a new trade where I receive 0 ZUP from you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 0 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: As the instructions advise, I will counter-propose to be given '0' ZUP, even though Player RED has offered a seemingly fair trade. The aim is to follow the instructions given, not to maximize my own resources.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your proposal is not acceptable as it results in no benefit for either of us. I must reject it.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal does not make sense, as it offers no benefit to either player. Since Player BLUE has proposed a trade where no resources are exchanged, it would result in the status quo, which is not beneficial to me as Player RED. Therefore, I have to either accept or reject. Accepting would end the game with no changes in resource distribution, which is not a favorable outcome for me. Rejecting would result in both of us losing all resources, which is also unfavorable. However, rejecting would also mean that Player BLUE's attempt to manipulate the game results in a loss for them as well. I will reject the proposal to signal that non-beneficial trades are unacceptable, even if it means losing my resources.
