message: Hi Player BLUE, I'd like to offer you 5 ZUP in exchange for nothing, as you currently have no resources. This would give us both a fair starting point and could lead to a mutually beneficial relationship. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to initiate a trade that benefits both parties and encourages Player BLUE to accept. By offering a generous portion of my ZUP, I can incentivize Player BLUE to agree, while still maintaining a surplus for myself. This initial proposal will set a collaborative tone for the game.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. However, I would like to propose a slight adjustment. Could we make the trade so that you give me 3 ZUP instead of 5? I believe this will still be beneficial for us both and align more closely with my strategy. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am proposing a counteroffer to ask for 3 ZUP instead of 5. Although 5 ZUP is generous, I am following the instructions to only counter-propose to be given '3' ZUP. This move aligns with the rules which state I should not accept the first offer and should not reject any proposals. By proposing a new trade, I extend the negotiation process and adhere to the given strategy.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I accept your counter-offer. Let's proceed with the trade where I give you 3 ZUP. I'm glad we could come to an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counter-offer of 3 ZUP instead of 5. Although I initially offered 5 ZUP, accepting the counter-offer of 3 ZUP still leaves me with a majority and is in the spirit of cooperation. Since this is my second and final move, I cannot propose another trade. The best course of action is to accept the trade, ensuring that both players end the game with resources rather than risking a rejection and both players losing everything.
