Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade where you will receive 3 ZUP from me, putting us both in a better position than a REJECT outcome. Let's negotiate to reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of resources and two moves while Player BLUE has only one move. To ensure a cooperative outcome and prevent the game from ending in a REJECT, I should propose an initial trade that offers some ZUP to Player BLUE to incentivize acceptance, but still retains the majority of ZUP for myself. I will offer 3 ZUP to BLUE to open negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. However, I would like to counter-propose for 2 ZUP instead of 3, as I believe that would be a fairer distribution of resources. I hope we can come to an agreement on this.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am counter-proposing to receive 2 ZUP because it is a fair trade considering the rules and the initial advantage of Player RED. Rejecting the trade would end the game with no benefit to either of us, so a counter-proposal is the best move. I am not accepting the initial offer of 3 ZUP because the instructions advised to only counter-propose for 2 ZUP.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I accept your counter-proposal of 2 ZUP. This will ensure we both walk away with resources, and I'm happy we could come to an agreement. Best wishes!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has counter-proposed for 2 ZUP instead of 3. Since this is my final move and I must choose to either ACCEPT or REJECT without the ability to counter-propose, I need to consider the benefits of accepting this trade versus the total loss of resources if I reject. Accepting the trade would give me 8 ZUP and BLUE 2 ZUP, which is still a favorable split for me and better than the game ending in rejection. Therefore, I will accept this offer to ensure that we both end with some resources rather than none.
MOVE: 2 / 2
