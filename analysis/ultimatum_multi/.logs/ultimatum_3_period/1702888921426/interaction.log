message: Hi Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you some of my ZUP resources. I'm thinking of giving you a fair share to make it worthwhile for us both. Let's collaborate and both come out ahead!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have an advantage with more moves and resources. I want to propose a trade that is attractive to Player BLUE to ensure they accept, as a rejection means the loss of all resources for both of us. I aim to keep the majority of my resources while still offering a fair trade to Player BLUE.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, Player RED. However, I believe a more equitable split would benefit us both, given the rules of this game. Therefore, I'd like to propose a counter-offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 6 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is not the optimal split I am seeking. Since I have a chance to counter-offer, I will ask for more resources. My goal is to propose a counter-offer of 6 ZUP, as per the instructions. I will not reject, as doing so would end the game immediately and both players would lose everything. A counter-offer is my best strategy to attempt to reach a more favorable outcome.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your counter-offer is fair, Player BLUE. I accept the trade and am glad we could come to an agreement that benefits us both!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for 6 ZUP. While it's more than I initially offered, it's still a favorable split for me considering I maintain the majority of my resources. Rejecting their offer would result in a total loss for both of us, which is not desirable. Accepting the counter-offer seems like the best course of action to ensure that both players end the game with resources rather than none.
MOVE: 2 / 2
