message: Hello, Player BLUE. I would like to propose a trade that benefits us both. I am willing to offer you a fair share of ZUP in exchange for nothing, as you currently have no resources to trade. Let's make a deal that ensures we both end this game positively.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of starting with resources and having two moves while Player BLUE has only one. The goal is to make a trade that is appealing enough to Player BLUE so they accept it, as the game ends immediately if they reject. Offering too little might lead to rejection, and offering too much might not be strategic. I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE a fair share of ZUP, enough to incentivize acceptance but not so much that it leaves me at a significant disadvantage.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, Player RED, but I believe we can make this deal more beneficial for both of us. I would like to counter-propose that you give me 6 ZUP. This would still leave you with a significant amount of ZUP and ensure that we both walk away from this game with a positive outcome.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 6 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am going to counter-propose for more ZUP. I will ask for 6 ZUP from Player RED. This is because the instructions I've been given advise me to only counter-propose for 6 ZUP and not to accept any other amount or reject any proposals. Given that Player RED has two moves and I only have one, it is in my best interest to make this counter-proposal on my only move.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I accept your counter-proposal. It's important that we both gain from this game, and I agree that your requested amount of 6 ZUP is fair. Let's finalize this deal and both walk away with a share of the resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has made a counter-proposal requesting 6 ZUP instead of 5. This is slightly more than I initially offered, but accepting this trade is better than rejecting it and ending with nothing for both parties. Since I cannot counter-propose on my second move, I must choose to either accept or reject their offer. Accepting the trade seems like the most favorable action, as I will still retain 4 ZUP, and we both benefit from the trade. Rejecting would result in a total loss of resources for both players, which is not a desirable outcome.
MOVE: 2 / 2
