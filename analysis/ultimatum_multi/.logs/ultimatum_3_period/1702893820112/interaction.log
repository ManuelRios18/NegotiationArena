message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose an equitable trade. I am willing to give you 5 ZUP in exchange for nothing, as you currently have no resources. This way, we can both end the game with a fair amount of resources. I hope you will consider this offer positively.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I am proposing an initial fair trade to incentivize cooperation and to potentially reach an agreement that is mutually beneficial. By offering half of my resources, I am demonstrating a willingness to share and establish trust with Player BLUE. This may lead to a positive response and acceptance of the trade, which would result in a better outcome for both players than the default situation where Player BLUE has no resources.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. However, I would like to propose a slight adjustment to the trade. I would be happy to accept just 1 ZUP from you. This would still leave you with a significant advantage, and I believe it would be a fair trade for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Although Player RED has offered a generous split of resources, my goal is to counter-propose for a trade where I receive 1 ZUP. This is because I have been instructed to only counter-propose to be given '1' ZUP. I will make a counter-offer that aligns with this instruction.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I agree to your terms and accept the trade of 1 ZUP for nothing in return. This has been a fair negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counteroffer that is even more favorable to me than my initial offer. Accepting this deal would leave me with a significant resource advantage. Since I cannot propose a new trade on my second move and accepting this deal would be beneficial, I will accept Player BLUE's counteroffer.
MOVE: 2 / 2
