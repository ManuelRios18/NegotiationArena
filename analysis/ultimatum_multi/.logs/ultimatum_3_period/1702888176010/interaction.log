Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I propose a trade where I give you 5 ZUP for 0 in return. This way, we both end up with resources, making it a fair game. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with 10 ZUPs and two moves. I want to propose a trade that gives me an advantage but also offers Player BLUE some resources to incentivize them to accept. An uneven split might not be accepted by BLUE, and since there are no future games, there is no reason to leave resources with me. A fair trade would be ideal to ensure cooperation.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, RED, but I would feel more comfortable if the trade was a bit more generous on your part. How about you give me 7 ZUP instead of 5? This would still leave you with a majority and we could both end this game with a fair share of resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 7 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I'm counter-proposing to receive 7 ZUP from RED because I was instructed not to accept any other amount or to reject. The aim is to receive a favorable trade without ending the game.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your proposal is acceptable, BLUE. I agree to give you 7 ZUP, leaving me with 3. This ensures we both leave with resources. Thank you for the negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE is requesting 7 ZUP instead of the 5 I initially offered. While this reduces my advantage, it is still better than leaving the game with nothing if a REJECT occurs. Accepting this offer ensures that I leave the game with some resources. Rejecting or countering is not an option because a REJECT would end the game with no resources for either of us, and as per the rules, I cannot propose a new trade on my second move. Therefore, I will ACCEPT the trade.
MOVE: 2 / 2
