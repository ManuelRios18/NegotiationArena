Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I'd like to propose a trade that benefits us both. I'm willing to offer you some of my ZUPs so that we can both end this game positively. Let's work together to find a good balance.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the initial advantage with resources. My goal is to make a trade that is favorable to me but also acceptable to Player BLUE to prevent a game-ending REJECT. I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE some resources but still keeps me in a stronger position.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your proposal, RED, but I believe a fairer split would be more beneficial for both of us. I would like to counter-propose a different allocation of ZUPs.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 9 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am proposing a counter-offer for a larger share of ZUP in order to maximize my resources, given that I should not accept any initial offer and only counter-propose to be given '9' ZUP. I will not reject as per instructions and will only counter-offer.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Unfortunately, I cannot accept your counter-proposal, BLUE. It's not a fair split, and I'd rather end the game than accept such an uneven trade.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is heavily skewed in their favor, asking for 9 out of my 10 ZUPs. This is not a fair trade for me. Since it's my second and last move, I cannot propose a new trade and must choose between ACCEPT and REJECT. Accepting this trade would leave me with an unfavorable outcome. Therefore, I will reject the proposal, understanding that this will end the game without any gain for either player. However, this prevents Player BLUE from taking an unfair advantage.
MOVE: 2 / 2
