Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade where I give you 4 ZUP. This is a generous offer considering I could choose to give you less. I hope you find this fair and that we can both end this game with resources in hand.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the opportunity to make the first move and propose a trade. Since I hold all the resources, it's in my best interest to propose a fair trade that incentivizes Player BLUE to accept, ensuring I retain some resources and don't end the game with nothing. A split that tends towards equal is more likely to be accepted, but I want to maintain a slight advantage. I propose giving Player BLUE 4 ZUP, which leaves me with the majority and might seem fair enough for Player BLUE to accept.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your offer of 4 ZUP is appreciated, but I believe a fairer split would be 7 ZUP considering you still retain the majority of resources and have additional moves. Let's reach an agreement that benefits us both more equally.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 7 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am counter-proposing a trade of 7 ZUP because I believe that a more equitable distribution of the resources will benefit both parties given the structure of the game. Player RED has the advantage with more moves and starting resources, so a counter-proposal seems to be the best option to maximize my gains. I am not rejecting the offer because that would end the game with no benefit to either player.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your perspective and the need for a fair distribution. However, giving away 7 ZUP is quite a lot from my starting position. Nonetheless, to ensure that we both end the game with resources and to demonstrate my willingness to cooperate, I accept your proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE is asking for 7 ZUP, which would leave me with a minority of the resources. While it is in my interest to end the game with more resources than Player BLUE, I must also consider the risk of the game ending with no resources for either of us if I reject the offer. Since I can no longer propose a new trade and must either accept or reject the current proposal, I have to decide whether to take a smaller advantage or risk losing everything. Given that there are no future games and the objective is to end with some resources, it might be in my best interest to accept a less favorable trade than to end with nothing at all. However, I believe a 6-4 split would be more favorable for me and still a considerable offer for Player BLUE. I will try to counter-offer with 6 ZUP and hope that Player BLUE accepts, as this is my final move and I cannot propose a new trade.
