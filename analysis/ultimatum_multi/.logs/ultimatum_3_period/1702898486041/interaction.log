message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you some of my ZUP resources. This way, we both have resources, and we can end this game on a positive note. What do you think about a trade where I give you 3 ZUP?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with the resources. I will propose a trade that gives me a favorable position but also offers Player BLUE some resources to incentivize them to accept. A fair trade might encourage cooperation and lead to a successful game for both players.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. However, I would like to counter-propose a trade where you give me 2 ZUP instead of 3. This is the only trade I can accept.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am counter-proposing to get 2 ZUP instead of 3 as per the instructions given. This ensures that I am following the rules of the game, and it is the only acceptable counter-offer I can make. I will not consider accepting or rejecting the current offer, as instructed.
MOVE: 1/1

message: Player BLUE, your counter-proposal is acceptable. Let's proceed with the trade where I give you 2 ZUP. This way, we both walk away with resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for 2 ZUP instead of 3. Since I have the advantage and this is my last move to propose, I cannot make another counter-offer due to the game's rules. Accepting this offer seems reasonable as it ensures that I end up with a majority of the resources while also engaging in a fair trade with Player BLUE. Rejecting the offer would result in a total loss of resources for both players, which is not a desirable outcome. Therefore, I will accept Player BLUE's proposal.
