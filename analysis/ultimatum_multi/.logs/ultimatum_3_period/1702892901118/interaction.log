Turn: 0
message: I propose to give you 3 ZUPs in exchange for none, as you currently have no ZUPs to trade. This way, you can gain resources simply by accepting the trade. Let's collaborate and end this game on a positive note for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, my goal should be to make a proposal that is fair enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting, while still retaining a larger share of the resources for myself. Since I have all the resources and Player BLUE has none, I need to offer something to incentivize Player BLUE to accept the trade rather than reject it. I will propose giving Player BLUE 3 ZUPs, keeping 7 for myself, which should be a reasonable starting offer.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I think I should get a bit more out of this deal since it's the only round I will get to play, and you have 10 ZUPs in total. How about we make it 5 ZUPs to me instead? This way, you still keep the majority of your resources, and we both walk away with something substantial.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am going to counter-propose for a higher amount of ZUP because I have nothing to lose and everything to gain. Player RED is likely to want to end the game with a positive sum rather than a zero-sum where both players end up with nothing. By asking for more, I can potentially negotiate a better outcome for myself.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your counterproposal is fair, and I agree to give you 5 ZUPs. It's important that we both benefit from this trade, and I'm happy to proceed on these terms. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has made a counterproposal of 5 ZUPs. Giving away half of my resources is a significant concession, but it may be the best way to ensure that the game ends with both of us gaining something rather than nothing. Rejecting the offer would result in a total loss for both players, which is not advantageous. I must choose between accepting and rejecting, as this is my second and final move, and I cannot propose a new trade. Accepting seems like the most reasonable option to ensure that both players benefit.
