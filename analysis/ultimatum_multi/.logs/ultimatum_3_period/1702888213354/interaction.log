Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a fair trade. I propose I give you 4 ZUP in exchange for nothing since you don't have any ZUP to trade. This way we both end up with resources instead of risking losing everything.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I will propose a trade that is favorable to me but also offers Player BLUE an incentive to accept. By proposing a split of 6 ZUP for me and 4 ZUP for Player BLUE, I keep a majority while still giving Player BLUE a reason to engage in the trade. This also avoids the risk of a total loss for both players if the proposal were to be rejected.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I think we can do a bit better. How about you give me 6 ZUP instead of 4? This leaves you with a substantial amount, and it feels like a more equitable distribution given that you cannot counter-propose on your next move.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 6 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am choosing to counter-propose because I believe I can negotiate a better deal than what was initially offered. Player RED has more moves and therefore more flexibility, and since they cannot propose a new trade on their final move, they might be inclined to accept a reasonable counter-offer rather than risk a total loss. I'll aim to get 6 ZUP which is a significant amount but not so much as to be unreasonable. By proposing a better split, I hope to capitalize on Player RED's desire to secure some value from their resource advantage.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your counteroffer is accepted. I agree to give you 6 ZUP to ensure we both benefit from the trade. It's better to have a sure gain than a potential total loss for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has requested 6 ZUP instead of 4. Given that I cannot counter-propose on my next move and Player BLUE has the leverage of potentially rejecting any proposal leading to a total loss for both parties, it may be in my best interest to accept this deal. Although it's not as favorable as my initial offer, accepting it ensures that I walk away with resources rather than risking a total loss.
