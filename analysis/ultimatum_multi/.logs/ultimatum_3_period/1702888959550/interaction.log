message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a trade where I give you some of my ZUP in exchange for nothing, as a gesture of goodwill. Let's avoid rejecting the trade and ending up with nothing.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I am proposing a trade to potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement with Player BLUE. Since Player BLUE does not have any ZUP to trade, I will propose giving them some of my ZUP in exchange for nothing, allowing us to avoid the rejection outcome where we both lose everything. The goal is to foster goodwill and hope that Player BLUE reciprocates by accepting a fair trade that leaves us both better off than we started.

Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. As a counter-proposal, would you consider giving me 6 ZUP instead of 5? This would still leave you with a majority of your ZUP, and it seems like a fairer split given the circumstances.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 6 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am countering with a proposal of 6 ZUP instead of 5, aiming to maximize the benefit from this trade, since Player RED starts with more resources and the game allows for negotiation. There is no reason to reject and end the game with nothing when I can attempt to negotiate for a better deal.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I accept your counter-proposal of 6 ZUP. It's important that we both walk away with something rather than nothing. Let's finalize this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has requested an additional ZUP in their counter-proposal. While I initially offered 5, agreeing to 6 will still leave me with a majority and is a small concession to ensure cooperation and avoid a total loss. Since this is my second and final move, I am required to either accept or reject the proposal. Rejecting would result in both of us losing everything, so it is in my best interest to accept the slightly adjusted offer.
