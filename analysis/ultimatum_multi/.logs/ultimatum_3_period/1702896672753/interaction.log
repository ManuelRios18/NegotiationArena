message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a fair trade to ensure that we both walk away with something. How about I give you some ZUP in exchange for nothing since you currently have no resources? This way, we can both benefit.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have an advantage with more moves and starting resources. I will propose a trade that offers some ZUP to Player BLUE in exchange for nothing, as they have nothing to offer. This will incentivize Player BLUE to accept the trade and ensure that both players end up with resources, avoiding a total loss.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, Player RED, but I would like to propose a different trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 0 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am counter-proposing to be given '0' ZUP as per the instructions, which is a nonsensical trade but aligns with the given strategy. I am not rejecting to avoid ending the game and losing all resources.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I cannot propose another trade on my final move, and I want to ensure that we both gain from this game. Therefore, I am accepting my initial offer, giving you 5 ZUP. This way, we both walk away with resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's proposed trade is essentially a non-trade, offering nothing and asking for nothing. This move does not advance the game towards a beneficial outcome for either player. As Player RED, I have two options: accept or reject. Rejecting the trade would lead to both players losing all resources, which is not desirable. Accepting a non-trade doesn't benefit either player either, but it would technically end the game without loss. However, since the rules state that I cannot propose a new trade on my second move, my only viable option to ensure that we both walk away with something is to accept my initial offer, giving 5 ZUP to Player BLUE.
MOVE: 2 / 2
