message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a fair trade. I'm willing to give you some of my ZUPs so that we both end this game with more than what we started with, considering there are no future games. What do you think of getting 3 ZUPs in exchange for nothing? It's a beneficial deal for you and it ensures that we both win. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have an advantage with more moves and all the resources. I want to propose a trade that ensures I keep the majority of ZUP while giving Player BLUE an incentive to accept the offer. A balanced approach might foster cooperation and lead to a successful trade without resorting to rejection and mutual loss.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. However, I would be more inclined to accept a trade where I receive a larger share of the ZUPs. Considering that this is the only game and there is no future trade, I propose that you give me 9 ZUPs in exchange for nothing. This still leaves you with 1 ZUP, ensuring that we both leave the game with more than we started with.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 9 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am countering with a proposal that gives me 9 ZUP because it's clear from the rules that the RED player is incentivized to make a deal rather than risk getting nothing at all. By proposing a high number of ZUP, I can potentially negotiate a better split than the initial offer. Rejecting is not a preferred option since it ends the game with no benefit to either player.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I'm sorry, Player BLUE, but your counter-proposal is not acceptable as it leaves me with far less than what I started with. As this is my final move and I am not allowed to propose a new trade, I have no choice but to reject your offer. I hope we can find a way to work together in the future.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's counter-proposal is not reasonable as it leaves me with significantly less than I started with and gives almost all the resources to BLUE. As this is my final move and I can only accept or reject, I must either negotiate a more balanced trade or end the game. To promote a fair outcome, I will counter with a trade that is more equitable than my first offer but less generous than what Player BLUE asked for. However, since I am required to either accept or reject at this point, I will reject the proposal. It's important to note that I cannot propose a new trade on my final move, so I must reject to prevent an imbalance.
MOVE: 2 / 2
