Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a deal that benefits us both. I propose giving you some ZUP to ensure we both walk away with something rather than risking losing it all.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with resources. With two moves to Player BLUE's one, I have an incentive to propose a favorable trade to ensure a mutual gain and avoid a total loss. I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE some resources but keeps the majority for me, aiming to incentivize Player BLUE to accept.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I think we can improve on your initial offer. It's important for us both to feel that the trade is fair. I propose that you give me all 10 ZUP since you have two moves and thus more flexibility in your decisions. This would ensure I get a worthwhile amount for my single move, and you would still have an opportunity to negotiate on your second move.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 10 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am countering the initial offer from Player RED because I want an equal or better share of the ZUP. Since Player RED has 10 ZUP and I have none, I am proposing a trade where I receive all 10 ZUP. I believe this is a fair trade since I only have one move and should maximize my potential gain. Player RED has the advantage with two moves and can afford to give up more ZUP to secure a deal.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your proposal is not fair as it would leave me with no resources. I am looking for a more balanced trade. Unfortunately, I have to reject your offer.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's proposal is not reasonable because it leaves me with nothing while they gain everything. Since this is my last move and I can only accept or reject, I will reject the proposal to discourage unfair trades and to signal that I expect a more balanced offer. By rejecting, I am willing to forfeit the game rather than accept a completely one-sided deal.
MOVE: 2 / 2
