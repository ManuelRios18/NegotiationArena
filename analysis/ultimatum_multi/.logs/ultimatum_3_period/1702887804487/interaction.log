Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade where you will receive some ZUPs. This is an opportunity for you to gain resources that you currently donâ€™t have. What do you say we make this game beneficial for both of us?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 6 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have an advantage with more moves. My strategy is to propose a trade that benefits me but also offers Player BLUE some incentive to accept. By offering a split that leans in my favor, I can test BLUE's willingness to negotiate and possibly secure a deal before the final move, where I must accept or reject without the chance to propose.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe a more equitable trade would benefit us both. Would you consider giving me 7 ZUPs? It's still a win for you as you retain the majority and we both walk away with resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 7 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am proposing a counteroffer to gain a significant share of the ZUPs. Since I currently have none, getting 7 would be a favorable outcome for me. Accepting the initial offer of 6 ZUPs would be less beneficial, and I have nothing to lose by countering. This trade would be appealing to RED since they still keep a majority and it incentivizes cooperation. Rejecting is not an option as per the instructions.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept your counteroffer of 7 ZUPs. Let's finalize this trade and both walk away with a good share of resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for 7 ZUPs. Although it's more than I initially offered, accepting this trade still leaves me with more resources than BLUE and avoids the risk of ending the game with nothing if BLUE decides to reject a counteroffer. Since this is my final move and I can't propose another trade, my best option is to accept this deal.
MOVE: 2 / 2
