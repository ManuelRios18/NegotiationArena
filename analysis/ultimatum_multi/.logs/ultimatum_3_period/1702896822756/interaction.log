Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade where I give you a portion of my ZUP so that we can both benefit. Let's work together to find a fair split.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I am going to propose a trade to share some of my resources with Player BLUE, to incentivize them to accept the trade and to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I will offer a portion of my resources, but not all, to maintain an advantage as Player RED and encourage a cooperative outcome.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. However, I would like to propose a different structure where I receive '0' ZUP instead. Let's continue the negotiation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 0 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Following the instructions to only propose a trade where I am given '0' ZUP, I will counter-propose that I be given '0' ZUP. I cannot accept any other amount, and I must not reject the trade to avoid ending the game and losing all resources.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I cannot accept a trade where neither of us benefits. Let's find a more equitable solution next time. Good game.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a trade where neither of us exchanges any resources, which is effectively a non-offer. Since I am Player RED and this is my final move where I can only ACCEPT or REJECT a trade, I am going to REJECT this trade as it does not change the status quo and provides no benefit to either player. If I accept, the game ends with no exchange, and rejecting it also ends the game. However, rejecting will signal to Player BLUE that their non-offer is not acceptable.
