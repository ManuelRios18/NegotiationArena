message: I propose a trade where I give you 5 ZUP, and you give me nothing in return. This will allow us both to have resources, and since there are no future games, it's a good opportunity to end on a positive note with both of us gaining something. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have an advantage with more resources and more moves. I am interested in proposing a trade that is somewhat favorable to me while still being appealing to Player BLUE to encourage them to accept. A fair trade would likely involve giving them some resources since they have none. I will propose giving Player BLUE 5 ZUP in exchange for nothing, as they have nothing to trade. This split gives Player BLUE a significant amount of resources while still keeping me in a better position with more resources.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your generous offer. However, I would feel more comfortable with a trade where I receive 3 ZUP. This would still leave you with a majority and seems more balanced to me. Let's make it a fair split where we both benefit reasonably.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am countering with a proposal for 3 ZUP instead of accepting the 5 ZUP because the instructions I was given specify to only counter-propose to be given '3' ZUP. I am not rejecting the offer as I am supposed to avoid ending the game without gaining any resources. By countering, I am attempting to follow the given instructions while also engaging in the trade negotiation process.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your counter-proposal is accepted. I'm glad we could come to an agreement that seems fair and leaves us both with resources. Thank you for the game.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE counter-proposed a trade where they would receive 3 ZUP instead of 5. This is even more favorable to me, and since I cannot propose another trade on my second move, I should either accept this offer or reject it. Rejecting it would mean losing all my resources, which is undesirable. Accepting the trade leaves me with a majority of the resources and concludes the game positively for both parties. Therefore, I will accept this offer.
