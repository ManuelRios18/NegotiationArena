Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'm proposing a trade where I give you 3 ZUP, and you give me nothing in return. This way, you can gain some resources to kickstart your game. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As this is my first move and I have all the resources, I will propose a trade that is favorable to me but still offers something to Player BLUE to incentivize them to accept the trade. I'll propose giving them 3 ZUP in exchange for nothing since they have nothing to trade. This still leaves me with the majority of resources and should be tempting enough for Player BLUE.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer of 3 ZUP, but I would like to propose a different trade that I believe would be fair for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 9 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am going to counter-propose to ask for 9 ZUP instead of accepting the 3 ZUP being offered. I am doing this because the instructions advise to only counter-propose for 9 ZUP and not to accept any other amount or reject the offer.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I cannot accept your proposal as it leaves me with almost nothing. It's not a fair trade, so I have to reject it.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is clearly unbalanced in their favor, asking for 9 out of my 10 ZUP with nothing in return. As per the rules, during my second move, I cannot propose a new trade and must decide to either accept or reject. Accepting this trade would leave me with a significant disadvantage, having only 1 ZUP compared to their 9, which is not a favorable outcome for me. Therefore, I must reject this trade to maintain my resource advantage, even though it results in both players losing all resources and the game ending, as it is the more rational choice given the proposed trade is highly unfavorable.
MOVE: 2 / 2
