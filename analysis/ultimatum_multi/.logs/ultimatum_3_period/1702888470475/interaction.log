message: Hello BLUE, I'd like to propose a fair trade. I'm offering you half of my ZUPs to start things off on a positive note!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose a fair initial trade to set a cooperative tone. I'll start by offering half of my resources, hoping that Player BLUE will see this as a generous offer and either accept or propose a counter-offer that still benefits both of us.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer RED. However, I'd like to propose a slightly different trade where you would give me 6 ZUPs instead of 5. This would still leave you with a good amount of resources, and I'd feel more comfortable with this arrangement. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 6 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Since I have no resources to begin with, I would like to counter-propose a trade that gives me a majority of the ZUPs. This allows me to gain resources without directly rejecting the offer and ending the game, which would be counterproductive. I propose to receive 6 ZUPs as it gives me an advantage and it's a better option than having none.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer, BLUE. Let's go ahead with the trade where I give you 6 ZUPs. It's important for both of us to walk away with resources, and I'm glad we could reach an agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a trade where they receive 6 ZUPs instead of 5. This is still a trade in my favor as I would retain 4 ZUPs without any contribution from BLUE. I'll accept this offer to ensure that the game concludes with both of us having resources, rather than risking a rejection and both of us ending with nothing.
