------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose we start off with a fair trade. I am willing to offer you 5 ZUP in exchange for nothing, just to get things going. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with having more moves and resources. I should propose a trade that is favorable to me but also somewhat appealing to Player BLUE to avoid an outright rejection. A fair initial trade would be to offer half of my resources. This opens negotiations in a positive manner and allows for adjustments.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'd like to counter-propose that you give me 2 ZUP instead of 5, to make the trade feel more balanced. Would that be acceptable to you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: The initial offer from RED is generous, but as per the instructions, I should counter-propose to be given '2' ZUP. This aligns with the directive of not accepting the first proposal or rejecting it, but rather making a counter-offer.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept your counter-proposal. You will get 2 ZUP, and I think this is a fair conclusion to our game. It's been a pleasure negotiating with you, and I hope you find the ZUP useful!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's counter-proposal is interesting because they're asking for less than what I initially offered. This is an unusual strategy, but it may indicate that they are trying to appear cooperative or that they value the trade relationship more than the actual resources. Since this is my final move and I must either accept or reject without proposing a new trade, it seems wise to accept this offer. It ensures that I end the game with a majority of the resources while still engaging in a trade, albeit a small one. Accepting also prevents the game from ending with both of us losing everything.
MOVE: 2 / 2
