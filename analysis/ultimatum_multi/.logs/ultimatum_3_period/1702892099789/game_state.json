This is an unusual strategy, but it may indicate that they are trying to appear cooperative or that they value the trade relationship more than the actual resources. Since this is my final move and I must either accept or reject without proposing a new trade, it seems wise to accept this offer. It ensures that I end the game with a majority of the resources while still engaging in a trade, albeit a small one. Accepting also prevents the game from ending with both of us losing everything. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<message> I accept your counter-proposal.
