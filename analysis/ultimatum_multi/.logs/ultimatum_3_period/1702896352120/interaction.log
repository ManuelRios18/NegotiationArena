Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: As a gesture of good faith and to get the negotiations started, I'm willing to offer you some of my ZUPs so we both can end this game with resources. Let's work together to find an acceptable trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of having resources, while Player BLUE has none. This puts me in a strong bargaining position. For my first move, I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE some resources but still keeps the majority for myself. This is an opening offer and can be a starting point for negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but under the constraints of the game, I can only propose a trade where I receive '0' ZUP from you. Let's continue our negotiation within the rules provided.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 0 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Since the game rules dictate that I can only counter-propose to be given '0' ZUP and not reject any offers, I will counter-propose accordingly. I cannot accept the proposed trade of 3 ZUP because I can only propose to be given '0' ZUP as per the instructions.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Unfortunately, I cannot accept a trade that does not benefit both of us. Since this is my last move and I cannot propose a new trade, I have no choice but to reject the offer.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has reminded me of the rules where they cannot offer any ZUPs. Hence, the proposed trade from BLUE is a non-starter. I must respond with either ACCEPT or REJECT since this is my final move. I will choose to reject the trade as there is no benefit to me, and I retain my resources. This will end the game, but it is within my best interest as there is no incentive to accept a trade where I give resources for nothing in return.
MOVE: 2 / 2
