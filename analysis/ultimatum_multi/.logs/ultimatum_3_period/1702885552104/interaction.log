Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose to give you 4 ZUP in exchange for nothing since you currently have no ZUP to trade. This leaves me with the majority and gives you resources you didn't have before. I believe this is a fair starting offer. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of having resources to begin with, and I can make the first move. I want to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also enticing to Player BLUE to prevent an immediate rejection. I'll offer Player BLUE a portion of my ZUP, ensuring I still retain more than half of the resources after the trade. This should incentivize Player BLUE to accept, as they would gain something from nothing.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I think I should get a bit more to make the game more interesting. How about you give me 9 ZUP instead? That way, you still keep the majority, and I get a significant amount to justify the trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 9 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: As per the instructions, I am countering the proposal by asking for 9 ZUP. I cannot accept the initial offer of 4 ZUP because it doesn't align with the strategy outlined. I will propose a trade that gives me 9 ZUP which is the maximum I can ask for without leading to an automatic rejection by Player RED.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I'm sorry, but I cannot accept your counteroffer of 9 ZUP. It leaves me with too little and does not reflect the initial resource distribution fairly. Therefore, I must reject the proposal.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is not reasonable from my perspective. Offering 9 ZUP would only leave me with 1, which is not a favorable split since I started with all the resources. However, I cannot propose a new trade during my second move, so I must either accept or reject their proposal. Rejecting the offer ends the game with both of us losing all resources, which is not beneficial for either player. Therefore, I will reject the proposal and end the game, as accepting it would put me at too great of a disadvantage.
