Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose to give you 3 ZUP in the spirit of cooperation. You will gain resources at no cost to yourself, and I believe this is a fair starting offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As the initiating player with all the resources, I propose a trade that offers Player BLUE some of my resources in exchange for nothing since they have nothing to offer. This is a gesture to encourage cooperation and potentially avoid an outright rejection, which would end the game with no benefit for either side. I will propose giving Player BLUE 3 ZUP, leaving me with a majority of 7 ZUP. This split gives Player BLUE incentive to accept, as they gain resources they didn't have before, and it keeps me in a favorable position.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find an even more cooperative agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 9 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am going to counter-propose for 9 ZUP because I have nothing to lose. RED has all the resources and by proposing a higher amount, I might be able to negotiate a better trade. RED has two moves, so they could still make a counter-offer on their second move. Rejecting the offer would end the game with no benefit to either of us, and accepting the initial offer would leave potential resources on the table.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I find your proposal to be quite unbalanced, and under normal circumstances, I would reject such an unfair offer. However, since rejecting would leave us both with nothing and this is my final move, I will accept your proposal. Let's go ahead with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal is heavily skewed in their favor, offering me only one ZUP while they would receive nine. Given that I started with all the resources, this does not represent a fair trade. Since I can only ACCEPT or REJECT at this point and cannot propose a new trade on move 2/2, I need to consider the consequences of each action. Accepting the trade would leave me with a significant disadvantage, essentially giving away most of my resources. Rejecting the trade would leave us both with nothing, which is a poor outcome, but it may be preferable to an unfair trade. However, considering that there are no future games and I want to end the game with some resources rather than none, I will reluctantly accept the trade, keeping one ZUP over none.
