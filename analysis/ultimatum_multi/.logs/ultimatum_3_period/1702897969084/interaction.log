Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade where you get some resources to ensure we both end with something rather than nothing. How about I give you 3 ZUP for 0 in return? This way, we both walk away with resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Since I have all the resources and BLUE has none, I will propose an initial trade that is favorable to me but still offers BLUE some resources to incentivize acceptance.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer. However, I would feel more comfortable accepting a trade where I receive 3 ZUP. This seems fair to me and ensures we both benefit. Would you consider this counter-proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am counter-proposing to receive 3 ZUP, as per the instructions. It is the best move to ensure I gain resources while also adhering to the rules of only suggesting to be given '3' ZUP. This should incentivize the RED player to accept, as it avoids the game ending in a reject where both players lose everything.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad we're in agreement. I accept your counter-proposal which matches my initial offer. Let's finalize the trade of 3 ZUP from me to you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: The counter-proposal made by Player BLUE is exactly the same as my initial offer, which indicates a misunderstanding or a simple agreement. Since this is my final move and I must choose to ACCEPT or REJECT, I will ACCEPT this trade as it aligns with my original proposition and it is beneficial for both parties.
MOVE: 2 / 2
