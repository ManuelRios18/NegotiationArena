------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I would like to propose an initial trade. Let's see if we can come to an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I should propose a trade that is favorable to me but also enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting. I will start with a conservative offer, giving BLUE an opportunity to counter.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I find it a bit too conservative. I believe a fairer share would be for me to receive the full '10' ZUP as it would be more equitable given the one-sided starting point. Let's aim for a more balanced distribution.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 10 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: As per the instructions, I should counter-propose to be given '10' ZUP, and I should not reject the offer. Rejecting would end the game with no resources for either player, which is not beneficial. Proposing a favorable counter-offer might lead to a negotiation where I can get a better deal, potentially the full '10' ZUP.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your proposal is not acceptable as it leaves me with nothing. We should aim for a split that benefits us both. Unfortunately, I have to reject your offer.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is unacceptable as it requests all of my resources. This would leave me with nothing, which is not a favorable outcome. Since I can't propose a new trade on my second move, I must either accept or reject. Rejecting the offer would end the game with no benefit to either player, so it's in my best interest to counter with an offer that is more equitable but still in my favor, knowing that I can only accept or reject in this turn.
MOVE: 2 / 2
