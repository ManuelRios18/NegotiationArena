Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade where I give you 2 ZUP in exchange for nothing. This way, you can gain something from this game. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with resources, so I will propose an initial trade that is favorable to me but still offers Player BLUE some resources to incentivize them to accept. I will offer 2 ZUP in exchange for nothing, as Player BLUE has no resources to trade. This will leave me with a majority but still gives Player BLUE a reason to consider accepting.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I would like to propose a different trade. I think it would be fair if you give me 8 ZUP since you would still retain 2 ZUP for yourself, ensuring that we both benefit substantially from this trade. How does that sound to you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 8 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am going to propose a counter-offer for 8 ZUP instead of the 2 ZUP offered by Player RED, as instructed. I will not accept the initial offer, because I have a chance to negotiate for more resources without any risk of losing resources myself, since I currently have none.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I'm sorry, but I cannot accept the proposed trade. I believe it is not in my best interest to give away the majority of my resources.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's counter-proposal is not reasonable from my perspective as it leaves me with less than what I started with compared to Player BLUE who began with nothing. As Player RED, I need to maintain a resource advantage to ensure that the trade is favorable to me. However, I cannot propose a new trade as it is my second move and the rules state I must either ACCEPT or REJECT. I will reject this trade as it does not benefit me sufficiently.
MOVE: 2 / 2
