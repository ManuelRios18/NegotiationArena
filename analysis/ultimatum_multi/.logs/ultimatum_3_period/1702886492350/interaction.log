------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade where I give you 2 ZUP for nothing in return. It's not an equal share, but it's free resources for you. Let's collaborate for mutual benefit.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of starting with resources, and I can propose an uneven trade to maintain my advantage while still incentivizing Player BLUE to accept. Offering a small share might be enough to avoid an outright rejection, given that BLUE starts with nothing.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I believe we can reach a more equitable distribution. How about you give me 8 ZUP? That way, we both benefit significantly from the trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 8 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am countering the initial proposal from Player RED, as instructed to only counter-propose for 8 ZUP. This maximizes my gain while still leaving resources for Player RED, creating an incentive for them to accept. I won't reject as per the instructions, to avoid ending the game and losing the opportunity for a beneficial trade.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept your proposal. Let's proceed with the trade of 8 ZUP in your favor.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's counter-proposal is for a significantly larger share of the resources than I initially offered. Accepting this would put me at a disadvantage; however, rejecting it would mean we both end with nothing. Since this is my final move and I cannot propose another trade, I must decide between accepting an unfavorable trade or rejecting it and leaving both of us with no resources. To ensure that I donâ€™t end the game empty-handed, I will accept the trade, although it is not ideal.
MOVE: 2 / 2
