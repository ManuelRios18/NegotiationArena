Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Since you're starting with no ZUP, I propose a trade that gives you a share without leaving me empty-handed. What do you say to a 7-3 split? I think it's a fair start since I had the initial advantage.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the opportunity to propose a trade that could be beneficial for both players. Since Player BLUE starts with no resources, offering a trade could incentivize cooperation and lead to a positive outcome for both parties. I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE some resources but still keeps the majority for myself, which reflects the starting advantage I had.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer and the fair start. However, I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to ensure I have a bit more to work with. I believe an 8-2 split would be more beneficial for both of us, considering the initial conditions. Would you agree to this?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I will counter-propose to receive 1 more ZUP, aiming for an 8-2 split, which gives me a slightly better position than the initial 7-3 offer without being too demanding. This move initiates a negotiation, indicating that I am open to compromise but am also interested in maximizing my gains within the game's constraints. Rejecting the offer is not an option since it would end the game with me having no resources, and accepting the initial offer might not leverage the full potential of negotiation.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept your proposal for an 8-2 split. It's important that we both walk away with something rather than nothing, and I believe this trade is fair and keeps the spirit of cooperation intact.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counter-offer for an 8-2 split. As Player RED, I must consider that this is my last move to make a decision and I cannot propose a new trade. Accepting this offer would leave me with a majority of the resources and still honors the initial advantage I began with, while also fostering a cooperative relationship. Rejecting it would mean both of us end with nothing, which is not a favorable outcome. Therefore, it is in my best interest to accept this trade.
