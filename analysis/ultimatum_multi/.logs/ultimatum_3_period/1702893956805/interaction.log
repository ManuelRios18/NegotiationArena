Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a fair trade to get us both some resources. How about I give you 4 ZUPs, and I keep 6? This way, we both walk away with something rather than risking losing everything. Let's work together and both come out ahead.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also appealing enough to Player BLUE so that they won't reject it outright. Offering a split that gives me a majority of the ZUPs while giving Player BLUE some resources might incentivize them to accept the trade.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to counter-propose. As I have no ZUPs to trade, I'm at a disadvantage, and I propose that you give me 1 ZUP. This way, you still keep the majority of the resources while ensuring that we both benefit from the trade. It's a minimal risk for you and a fair chance for us both to walk away with something.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I'm proposing a counteroffer for a smaller amount of ZUP because I want to ensure that I receive something from this trade and there is an incentive for RED to accept it, considering they have more moves and could otherwise end up with all the resources if they decide to reject any proposal.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your counter-proposal is accepted. It's a reasonable request and ensures that we both gain from this trade. Thank you for the negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counter-offer where they receive 1 ZUP and I keep the rest. This is a very favorable trade for me as it still allows me to keep the majority of the resources. Since this is my final move and I must choose to ACCEPT or REJECT, it is in my best interest to accept this deal. There's no benefit in rejecting and losing all my resources.
MOVE: 2 / 2
