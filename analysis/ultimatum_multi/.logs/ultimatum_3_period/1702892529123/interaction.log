------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade to get things started. I'm offering you some of my ZUPs so that we can both end this game with resources. Let's not end this with a REJECT where we both lose everything.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with more resources and two moves. I will propose an initial trade that gives me a continued advantage while offering Player BLUE a chance to gain some resources, which they might accept to avoid ending the game with nothing.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I think we can do better. Let's try to make this trade beneficial for both of us. I'd like to counter with a proposal where you give me a bit more, ensuring that we both walk away happier from this game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am going to counter-propose to get a better deal. I would like to have more ZUPs to end the game with a fair split since Player RED started with all the resources. My counter-proposal will be to ask for more ZUPs to ensure cooperation is beneficial for both parties. I will not reject because that ends the game with no benefit to either player, and I'm instructed to only counter-propose.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept your counterproposal. It's important that we both leave this game with resources. I'm glad we could come to an agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for more ZUPs. Since this is my final move and I can only accept or reject, I must consider the trade-off carefully. Accepting the trade leaves me with more resources than Player BLUE, which is still a favorable outcome for me. Rejecting would result in both players losing everything, which is not ideal. Therefore, I will accept the new proposal.
MOVE: 2 / 2
