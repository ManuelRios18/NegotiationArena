Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a deal that benefits us both. I propose giving you some ZUPs to ensure we both end this game with resources rather than rejecting and ending with nothing.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose a trade that is favorable to me but still enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting. By offering a portion of my ZUPs, I can potentially secure an agreement and end the game with more resources than Player BLUE. I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE some ZUPs in exchange for none, as they have nothing to trade.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'd like to propose a different trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 0 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I'm rejecting the initial proposal made by Player RED as I am only allowed to counter-propose to be given '0' ZUP according to the given instructions. By making this counter-proposal, I keep the game going without directly rejecting the offer, which would end the game with both players losing all their resources.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you want a different trade, but since I cannot propose a new trade on my second move, I'll accept the initial offer I made. This way, you still gain resources, which is better than ending up with none. I hope we can come to a mutual agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a trade where nothing is exchanged, which is effectively the same as not trading at all. Since I have two moves and Player BLUE has one move, I must respond with either ACCEPT or REJECT because I can't propose a new trade on my second move. Accepting a trade where nothing happens is pointless, but rejecting means both players end with nothing. My best course of action is to propose an ACCEPT to my initial offer or a new split that is still in my favor but may be more acceptable to Player BLUE. Since I can't propose a new trade, I will accept my initial offer, hoping Player BLUE sees the value in gaining some resources rather than none.
