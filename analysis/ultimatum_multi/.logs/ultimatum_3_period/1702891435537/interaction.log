message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a fair trade to ensure we both end this game positively. How about I give you 4 ZUP, and we both walk away as winners?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of starting with all the resources. To maintain a cooperative approach and incentivize Player BLUE to accept a trade, I will offer a portion of my resources. An equal split may seem fair, but since I have two moves and Player BLUE has only one, I have some leverage. I will propose a trade that gives me a slight advantage while still being generous to Player BLUE.
MOVE: 1 / 2

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I believe that a slightly more equitable trade would be beneficial for us both. I propose that you give me 3 ZUP instead of 4. This way, you retain more of your resources while I still receive a fair share. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am countering the initial offer from Player RED as per the instructions to only counter-propose for '3' ZUP. Rejecting is not an option for me, as it would end the game with both players losing all their resources. A counter-offer of 3 ZUP is a strategic move to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate for a lower amount than they initially proposed, while still ensuring that I gain some resources.
MOVE: 1/1

message: Player BLUE, I agree to your counterproposal. It's a fair trade, and I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Let's finalize this trade and both enjoy our shares.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has made a counterproposal for 3 ZUP instead of 4. This is a reasonable counteroffer and ensures that I still end up with a majority of the resources. Since I cannot propose another trade in my second move and rejecting the offer would leave us both with nothing, it's in my best interest to accept this trade. By accepting, I ensure a positive outcome for both players.
MOVE: 2 / 2
