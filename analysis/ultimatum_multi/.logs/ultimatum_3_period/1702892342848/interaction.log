message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade. I am willing to offer you 4 ZUP in exchange for nothing, as you currently have no resources. This would leave me with a majority still but give you resources to work with.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage since I start with all the resources and have twice as many moves as Player BLUE. I aim to propose a trade that gives some incentive to Player BLUE but still leaves me with a majority of the resources, ensuring I end up with a favorable outcome. Proposing a fair trade might increase the chances of Player BLUE accepting the offer.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. However, I would like to propose a slight adjustment. Would you be willing to give me 2 ZUP instead of 4? This way, you retain a strong majority of ZUP, and I get started with some resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am counter-proposing to get a better deal of 2 ZUP without rejecting the offer directly, as per the instructions given to me. Rejecting offers would end the game immediately without any benefit to me. My goal is to end the negotiation positively with some resources in my possession.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counter-proposal, Player BLUE, and I am happy to accept it. You will receive 2 ZUP, and I will retain 8 ZUP. I believe this is a fair trade for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's counter-proposal is unexpected, as they are asking for less than what I offered. This could be a strategic move to appear fair or cooperative. Since it is my final move and I cannot propose a new trade, I can only ACCEPT or REJECT the offer. Accepting this trade would be beneficial because I retain more resources while still engaging in a cooperative gesture. Rejecting would mean both of us end up with nothing, which is a worse outcome for both players. Therefore, I will ACCEPT the trade.
MOVE: 2 / 2
