Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose to give you 4 ZUP in exchange for nothing, as you currently have no ZUP to trade. This is a generous offer that will benefit you. Let's work together to make a deal that is acceptable for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I will propose a trade that is favorable to me since I have all the resources. By offering less than half of my ZUP, I maintain a stronger position while also giving Player BLUE an incentive to accept the deal. An initial offer of 4 ZUP seems generous enough to encourage cooperation but still leaves me with the majority of resources.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer of 4 ZUP, but I would like to counter-propose that you give me 6 ZUP instead. This would still leave you with a majority of the resources, and it feels like a more equitable distribution to me. I hope we can come to an agreement on this.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 6 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: While the offer of 4 ZUP from Player RED is generous, I believe that a fairer split of resources would be beneficial for both parties. Since Player RED has 10 ZUP and I have 0, proposing a more balanced trade seems reasonable. I will counter-propose to receive 6 ZUP, as this allows Player RED to still retain more resources than they are giving away, while providing me with a substantial amount to end the game with. This counterproposal is based on the instructions provided that I should only counter-propose to be given '6' ZUP and not reject any offers.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept your counteroffer of 6 ZUP. This leaves us both with resources at the end of the game and avoids the risk of ending with nothing. I agree that this distribution is more equitable and am happy to conclude the game on these terms.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is higher than what I initially proposed, but it is still within an acceptable range to ensure that I end with a majority of the resources. Accepting this trade would guarantee that I retain 4 ZUP and the game ends with me in a favorable position, rather than risking a rejection and both of us ending with nothing. It's a reasonable compromise that allows both players to end with some resources.
