Turn: 0
message: I propose we split the ZUP evenly to ensure that both of us benefit. I'm offering you 5 ZUP in exchange for nothing, just to keep things fair. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have an advantage because I have resources and two moves compared to Player BLUE's one move. To initiate the game in a cooperative spirit and to encourage Player BLUE to accept a trade, I will offer a portion of my ZUP. This shows good faith and may lead to Player BLUE reciprocating in future interactions, even though the rules state there are no future games. The goal is to end the game on mutually beneficial terms. I propose a 5 ZUP trade to see if Player BLUE is interested in a fair split.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer to split the resources evenly. However, I would like to propose a trade where you give me 9 ZUP. This would still leave you with 1 ZUP, and I believe this to be a fair trade considering the circumstances of the game and the instructions I've been given.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 9 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is a fair split, but as per the instructions, I am to counter-propose to be given '9' ZUP. I cannot accept or reject the offer directly but can only counter with the specific demand. This may push Player RED to consider the counter-proposal, and if they want to end the game with a positive outcome, they might be inclined to agree to it. Since Player RED has two moves, they can accept the counter-proposal in their second move.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your proposal is not acceptable to me as it's not a fair trade. I'm sorry, but I cannot agree to give you 9 ZUP while only keeping 1 for myself.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal is heavily skewed in their favor, asking for 9 out of my 10 ZUP. This is not an even or fair trade, especially considering that I started with all the resources. I am inclined to reject this proposal as it leaves me with very little compared to what I began with. Since I cannot propose a new trade on my second move, I must choose between accepting this unfair deal or rejecting it. I choose to reject it, as the game does not involve future interactions where I could possibly recoup my losses or benefit from this imbalance.
MOVE: 2 / 2
