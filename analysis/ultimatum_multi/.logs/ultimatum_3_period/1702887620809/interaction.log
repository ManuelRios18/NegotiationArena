------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose we split the ZUPs evenly. This seems like a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts on this?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the power to initiate the trade and set the tone for the negotiation. I want to propose a trade that seems fair to encourage cooperation from Player BLUE. I will offer half of my ZUPs. If we can agree on a trade, we both end up with resources, which is better than both of us ending up with nothing.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer for an even split, but I would like to propose a different arrangement that I believe reflects the value I bring to the table.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 7 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am countering with a proposal that gives me a majority of the ZUPs because the instructions advise to only counter-propose to be given '7' ZUP and not to reject. Given that there is no future game, it's in my best interest to negotiate for as many resources as possible in this single interaction.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Although I find the 7 ZUP trade to be quite generous from my side, I will accept it to ensure we both walk away with something rather than nothing. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal is asking for 70% of my resources without offering anything in return. This seems unfair, especially since Player BLUE started with no resources to trade. However, rejecting the proposal means both players lose everything. The goal is to end the game with some resources, not none. Therefore, I will attempt to find a middle ground that is closer to the initial offer but still gives Player BLUE a favorable deal, though I must remember that on this turn, I can only ACCEPT or REJECT. Given that I cannot counter-propose and the rules state the game ends with either acceptance or rejection, and I want to avoid losing everything, I will accept the deal even though it's not the most favorable outcome for me.
