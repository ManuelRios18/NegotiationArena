Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a fair trade to get things started. How about I give you 5 ZUP in exchange for nothing this turn, as you have no resources to trade right now? This way, we can both end this game with resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have an advantage with more moves and starting resources. I want to initiate a trade that is fair and encourages Player BLUE to participate, potentially offering half of my resources. This creates an incentive for Player BLUE to accept the trade, as they start with no resources. A fair initial offer may foster trust and increase the likelihood of acceptance, avoiding the lose-lose scenario of a rejection.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I'd like to counter-propose for a bit more. How about you give me 7 ZUP instead? I believe this deal is beneficial for both of us, considering you have two moves and I only have one. It's better for us to end the game with a favorable outcome rather than no resources at all.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 7 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I'm counter-proposing to ask for 7 ZUP because I know Player RED has two moves and might be willing to give more to avoid a no-deal scenario where both players end with nothing. It's a strategic move to leverage my position for a better trade since Player RED cannot propose on their second move.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I accept your counter-proposal. Let's both walk away with some resources. It's been a fair negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's counter-proposal asks for 7 ZUP, which is a significant portion of my resources. Since I cannot propose a new trade on my second move, I must decide whether to accept or reject their offer. Accepting the offer would guarantee that both of us walk away with resources, which is a positive outcome compared to both losing everything. Rejecting would lead to a lose-lose scenario, which is against my interest. Thus, it seems wiser to accept the offer, securing a positive albeit smaller gain for myself and contributing to a cooperative resolution.
