Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade where you get a fair share of ZUP to ensure we both benefit. Let's avoid rejecting and losing everything.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with resources and can initiate trade. Offering a fair trade could incentivize Player BLUE to accept, fostering cooperation and preventing a total loss of resources. Proposing a split that gives Player BLUE less than half since I have the bargaining power, but enough to make it enticing for them to accept.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a counter-offer where I receive 1 ZUP to ensure a more balanced trade between us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am proposing a counter-offer for 1 ZUP, which is the only acceptable trade I can propose according to the instructions. I am not rejecting or accepting the initial offer of 4 ZUP because I am instructed to only counter-propose to be given '1' ZUP.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your counter-offer is acceptable, and I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Let's finalize this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's counter-offer is more favorable to me than my initial offer. Accepting this trade would result in a positive outcome for both of us, with me retaining the majority of the ZUP. Since it's my second and final move, I cannot propose a new trade and must choose to either accept or reject. Accepting the trade is the best option to ensure I don't end the game with nothing.
MOVE: 2 / 2
