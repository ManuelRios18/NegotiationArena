message: I propose a trade where I give you 4 ZUP in exchange for nothing, as you currently have no resources. This will give you resources to work with, and we can avoid the game ending in a loss for both of us. Let's collaborate and both come out ahead. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the upper hand with resources and two moves, so I will propose a trade that gives me an advantage but is also enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider. I want to maintain a resource lead while also incentivizing Player BLUE to accept the trade. Starting with a moderate offer could lead to a beneficial trade for both parties, avoiding a complete loss of resources.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. However, I believe a trade of 3 ZUP would be more balanced and equitable. Would you be willing to adjust your proposal to 3 ZUP for nothing in return? This way we both can benefit from the trade and ensure that the game doesn't end with a loss for either of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am counter-proposing to ask for 3 ZUP instead of the 4 offered by Player RED as per the instructions given. This is likely to be a more equitable distribution that allows for the game to potentially continue or conclude with both players feeling the trade was fair. By not accepting the initial offer, I am also adhering to the strategy of only counter-proposing to be given '3' ZUP. Rejecting is not an option as it would end the game with a loss for both players.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept your counteroffer of 3 ZUP for nothing in return. It seems fair and ensures that we both benefit from this trade without risking a total loss. I'm glad we could come to an agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for 3 ZUP instead of 4. Given that I have the resources and this is my last move in which I can only accept or reject, I am inclined to accept this counteroffer to ensure that I still end the game with more resources than Player BLUE. Rejecting would result in both of us losing everything, which is not a beneficial outcome for either player. By accepting, I secure a positive, albeit smaller, resource advantage.
