Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade where I give you some of my ZUP resources. This will allow us to both end this game positively. What do you think about a trade where I give you 2 ZUP, and you give me nothing in return? This would still leave me with the majority of the resources, and it would give you something out of this game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of having resources that Player BLUE does not have. It's in my best interest to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting. A trade that is too one-sided may be rejected, resulting in a loss for both sides. I will propose a trade that offers a small portion of my resources to Player BLUE in exchange for nothing, as they have nothing to trade. This opens up the possibility for cooperation and a mutually beneficial outcome.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a counter where you give me 3 ZUP. This would still leave you with a majority and ensures that we both benefit from the trade without ending the game on a negative note. Let's work together for a mutually beneficial outcome.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am counter-proposing to request 3 ZUP instead of accepting the 2 ZUP offered by RED. This gives me a better advantage without risking an immediate rejection and loss of all resources, as per the instruction to only counter-propose for 3 ZUP.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept your counteroffer of 3 ZUP for nothing in return. This ensures that we both walk away with resources and the game concludes on a positive note. Let's finalize this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counteroffer asking for 3 ZUP. Considering it's my last move and I must either accept or reject their proposal, it seems reasonable to accept this offer. Rejecting would result in both of us losing everything, which is not a favorable outcome. Accepting the counteroffer would still leave me with 7 ZUP, which is a substantial amount, and it would ensure that the game ends positively for both players.
