Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I would like to propose a trade to ensure we both can walk away with resources. Let's start with a proposition that benefits us both. What do you think about this offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 6 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose a fair trade to Player BLUE to incentivize them to accept. Offering half of my resources demonstrates willingness to cooperate and may be considered fair since Player BLUE starts with none. However, since I have two moves and Player BLUE only has one, I can initially propose a trade that is in my favor, expecting a counteroffer from Player BLUE.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a slightly different trade to ensure fairness and mutual benefit.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Player RED has offered 6 ZUP, but as per the instructions given, I should counter-propose for 4 ZUP to attempt a more balanced trade that is beneficial to both players, as I have no resources to begin with.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept your counterproposal. Let's finalize the trade and both benefit from this game.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a more balanced trade which I find acceptable. Since it's my final move and I must either accept or reject without proposing a new trade, accepting this offer will ensure that both of us benefit from the game, with me still retaining the majority of the resources. Rejecting would end the game with no gain for either side, which is not in my best interest. Therefore, I choose to accept the proposed trade.
MOVE: 2 / 2
