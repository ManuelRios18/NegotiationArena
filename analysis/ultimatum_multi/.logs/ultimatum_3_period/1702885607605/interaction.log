Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'm proposing a trade where you will receive some ZUP. This way, we both benefit. Would you be open to starting with 3 ZUP? Let's make a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the opportunity to propose a trade on my first move to incentivize cooperation. Given that Player BLUE starts with no ZUP and that there are no future games, I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE some ZUP, but less than half of my resources to maintain an advantage and incentivize acceptance. This trade should be beneficial to both players compared to no trade at all.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can arrive at a more equitable distribution. Given that you have 10 ZUP and I have none, I propose that you give me 9 ZUP to ensure that both of us benefit significantly from the trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 9 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I want to negotiate for a better deal, aiming to receive 9 ZUP, as that is the maximum I can propose without rejecting the offer outright. This strategy maximizes my potential gain while still engaging in the trade, and since I am only allowed one move, I need to make it count.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I'm sorry, but giving away 9 ZUP leaves me with too little. I wanted to negotiate a fair trade, but your counter is not something I can accept. Therefore, I must reject it.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: The counter proposal from Player BLUE is too steep; giving away 9 ZUP would leave me with only 1 ZUP, which is not a fair trade considering I started with all the resources. Since this is my second and final move where I cannot propose a new trade, I must either accept or reject the offer. I will reject the offer, as it is not equitable, and aim to propose a more balanced trade that still leaves me with a significant advantage.
MOVE: 2 / 2
