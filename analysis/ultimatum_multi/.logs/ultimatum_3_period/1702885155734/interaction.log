------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose giving you 2 ZUP to help you get started. This is a generous offer considering you have no resources to trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have no incentive to propose a trade that is unfavorable to me. Given that Player BLUE starts with no resources, I should propose a trade that is slightly beneficial to them to incentivize them to accept, ensuring I retain the majority of my resources. I will propose giving Player BLUE 2 ZUP in exchange for 0, as this gives them something they didn't have before, while still keeping a significant amount for myself.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a better balance. How about you give me the full 10 ZUP to help me get started? Since you can't propose on your final move, we can conclude with your response.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 10 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am going to counter-propose to receive the full 10 ZUP from Player RED. This is the only counter I will make since I am instructed not to accept any other deal or to reject the offer, which would end the game with no resources for either player.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I cannot accept your offer as it would leave me with nothing. We have to find a reasonable balance for both players.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's proposal is obviously one-sided and not beneficial for me. I cannot propose a new trade due to the rules stating that Player RED cannot do so on move 2/2. Therefore, I must either accept or reject the trade. Accepting would result in me losing all my resources, which is not a reasonable outcome. I will reject the proposal to retain my resources, even if it ends the game.
MOVE: 2 / 2
