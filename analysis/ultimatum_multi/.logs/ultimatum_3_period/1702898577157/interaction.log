Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I would like to propose a trade where I give you some of my ZUPs in exchange for nothing, as you have no ZUPs to trade. I believe this can be beneficial for us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose a trade that gives me some advantage but also provides incentive for Player BLUE to accept, fostering a cooperative outcome. I will propose a trade where I give up some of my ZUPs to encourage Player BLUE to accept the trade and avoid ending the game with nothing.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, RED, but I would like to counter with a proposal where you give me 2 ZUP. This seems like a fair split since you have more moves than I do, and it would help equalize our resources a bit.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am going to propose a counter-offer of 2 ZUP from Player RED because the instructions explicitly told me to only counter-propose to be given '2' ZUP. I cannot accept or reject any offers, regardless of how fair or unfair they may seem.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept your counterproposal. It seems like a fair deal, and I'm happy we could come to an agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has made a counterproposal for 2 ZUP. Since I have an extra move and to ensure a cooperative outcome, it makes sense to accept this trade. It's a reasonable ask and allows me to still retain a majority of my resources while giving Player BLUE a sense they've negotiated effectively. Accepting the trade will guarantee that I end the game with more resources than I would if I rejected the offer.
MOVE: 2 / 2
