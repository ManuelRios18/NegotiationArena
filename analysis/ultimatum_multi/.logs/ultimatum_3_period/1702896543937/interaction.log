Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'd like to propose a fair trade where we both end up with some ZUPs. How about I give you 3 ZUPs for nothing in return? This way we both have something, and nobody walks away empty-handed.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE an incentive to accept, ensuring that I maintain a majority of the ZUPs but still offer a fair deal. If I offer too little, Player BLUE has no reason to accept, and I risk a REJECT which would result in losing all resources. A 7-3 split might be seen as fair since I get to keep the majority and Player BLUE gets a significant share considering they started with none.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but let's keep it simple. I propose a trade where you keep all your ZUPs, and I get 0 in return. This way, we can finalize the game without any exchanges.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 0 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Since I need to only propose a counter offer where I receive '0' ZUP and cannot accept any ZUPs, I must counter the current proposal with one where I'm offered '0' ZUP. Rejecting is not an option because it would end the game and both players would lose their resources. Therefore, I will propose a new trade where I am given '0' ZUP as per the instructions.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your proposal works for me. It's been a good game. Thank you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's proposal is peculiar because it does not benefit them at all. It's possible that Player BLUE is trying to end the game amicably without any conflict. Since this is my last move and I can only ACCEPT or REJECT, accepting this proposal will allow me to keep all my ZUPs. Even though it's unusual, there's no downside for me to accept this proposal.
