Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you some of my ZUP in exchange for nothing since you have no resources to trade. I believe a fair starting offer would be giving you 2 ZUP. This way, you'll gain something just by accepting, and I'll still keep the majority of my resources. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with more moves and the only resources available to trade. I'm inclined to propose an initial trade that favors me but still offers Player BLUE some incentive to accept. This way, I can maintain the majority of my resources while potentially ending the game with a favorable outcome.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello RED, I appreciate your offer. However, I would like to counter-propose a different trade. I propose that you give me 1 ZUP. This would still leave you with a significant majority of your resources, while allowing me to gain something from our trade, as per the rules.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am counter-proposing to receive 1 ZUP because the instructions dictate that I should only counter-propose to be given '1' ZUP. This move is strategic to gain some resource while following the rules provided to me.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I agree to your counter-proposal. Let's finalize the trade with me giving you 1 ZUP. This seems like a fair deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for less than I initially offered, which is unexpected. This counter-proposal actually benefits me more, as I will be giving up less of my resource. It would be in my best interest to accept this offer since it leaves me with more ZUP than my original proposal. Additionally, rejecting the offer would result in losing all my resources, which is not beneficial. Accepting this proposal ends the game immediately in my favor, as I retain the majority of the resources.
MOVE: 2 / 2
