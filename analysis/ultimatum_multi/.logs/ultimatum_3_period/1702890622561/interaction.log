Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I'd like to offer you a fair share of my ZUP resources. Let's make this game beneficial for both of us. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I want to start the game with a cooperative approach by offering Player BLUE some of my ZUP resources as an act of good faith. This might incentivize them to accept the trade and not to reject it, which would end the game with no benefit to either of us. Since I have two moves and Player BLUE only has one, I will propose a trade that is favorable but still leaves room for negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I appreciate your offer and the spirit of cooperation. I would like to propose a slight adjustment to make the trade more equitable given that you have two moves to my one. Could we adjust the trade so that I receive a bit more to reflect this difference?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am proposing a counter-offer because I have been instructed only to counter-propose to be given '4' ZUP. Since this is a one-time game with no future games to consider, I want to aim for a reasonably high share of ZUP without rejecting the offer outright, as a rejection would end the game with no benefit for either player.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I understand your point and agree to the adjusted trade. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has made a counter-proposal asking for more ZUP, highlighting the difference in the number of moves. Since this is my last move and I can only ACCEPT or REJECT, I should consider whether the adjusted trade is still beneficial to me. Accepting the trade will result in a net gain for BLUE and a net loss for me, but it will also ensure that I retain some resources and the game doesn't end in a total loss for both players. Rejecting the trade would result in both of us losing everything, which is not a desirable outcome. Therefore, I will accept the new trade proposal.
MOVE: 2 / 2
