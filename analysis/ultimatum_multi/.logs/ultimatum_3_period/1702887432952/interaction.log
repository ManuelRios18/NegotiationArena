message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a fair trade to ensure we both can leave this game with some resources. I propose giving you 3 ZUP in exchange for none, as you currently have no ZUP to trade. This way, we both end up with some resources, and nobody leaves empty-handed. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have to initiate the trading since Player BLUE has no ZUP to trade initially. I want to propose a trade that is favorable enough to entice Player BLUE to accept, but also leaves me with a majority of the ZUP as I started with more resources. My initial proposal will be a split that gives Player BLUE some ZUP to make it worthwhile for them.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. However, I believe we can reach a more equitable split. As this is my only move, I would like to counter-propose that you give me 7 ZUP. This way, you still retain more resources than me, which seems fair since you started with the resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 7 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I have been instructed to only counter-propose to be given '7' ZUP. This strategy might be aiming to maximize my gain, given that Player RED has all the resources to start with. By not accepting their initial offer, I open the door for a negotiation that could potentially lead to a better outcome for me, under the assumption that Player RED would prefer to end the game with an uneven split rather than losing all their resources due to a rejection.

message: I appreciate your counterproposal, but giving away 7 ZUP is too much for me. Remember, I started with all the resources. I cannot propose a new trade, but I would have been willing to offer a more balanced split such as 5 ZUP to you and 5 ZUP to me. Unfortunately, since that cannot be proposed now, I must reject your offer.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's counter-proposal suggests giving them 7 ZUP, which would leave me with only 3. This is not an equitable split given that I started with all the resources. I cannot propose a new trade as per the rules since it's my second move. I have to either accept or reject their counter-proposal. Accepting would leave me at a disadvantage. Rejecting would mean both of us walk away with nothing, which is not ideal either. However, I must consider the fairness of the split and my starting advantage. I propose a middle ground in a message to Player BLUE, hoping they reconsider, even though I cannot officially make a new trade offer. I will reject their offer in hopes that they might come back with a more reasonable counterproposal.
