Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a deal that benefits us both and avoid a total loss. I'm willing to give you a fair share of ZUP to ensure we both walk away with something.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage in resources, and it is in my best interest to propose a trade that is somewhat favorable to Player BLUE to incentivize them to accept, thereby securing a win for myself as well. Offering too little may lead to a rejection and a total loss for both players.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but let's adjust the terms to fit the guidelines we've been given.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 0 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for a trade that would give Player BLUE 5 ZUP in exchange for nothing. While this seems like a beneficial offer for Player BLUE, the instruction is to only counter-propose to be given '0' ZUP and not to reject any offers. Therefore, I will follow the instructions and counter-propose to be given '0' ZUP.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand that you're looking for a better deal. However, since this is my final move and we need to avoid a total loss, I will accept the current state where I retain my 10 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has not proposed an alternative trade, but rather just reiterated the conditions. As Player RED, it is my final move and I must choose to ACCEPT or REJECT their response. Since there's no actual proposal from Player BLUE, I interpret this as an implicit rejection of my initial offer. However, rejecting their response would result in a total loss for both of us. Therefore, I will accept the implicit proposal (which maintains the status quo) to avoid a total loss.
