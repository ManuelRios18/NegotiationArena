message: Hello BLUE, I'd like to offer you 3 ZUP in exchange for nothing, as I understand you have no resources to trade. This will give you a substantial amount to work with, and I hope you find this offer fair. Let's both walk away with something rather than risk losing it all.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of having resources while Player BLUE has none. I will propose a trade that gives me leverage while still offering BLUE something to incentivize acceptance. I will propose giving 3 ZUP to BLUE, which is a generous offer considering BLUE has no resources to start with. This will leave me with a majority of 7 ZUP and put the ball in BLUE's court to accept a deal or risk losing everything by rejecting the offer.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello RED, I appreciate your offer. However, I would like to counter-propose for 4 ZUP while still giving 0 in return. I believe this is a fair trade that allows us both to leave with a good amount of resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 3 ZUP for nothing in return, which is a fair starting point but I have been instructed to counter-propose for 4 ZUP. This counter-proposal is in line with the instructions provided and aims to maximize my gain without directly causing the game to end through rejection. It is also a reasonable ask given that Player RED has 10 ZUP and would still retain the majority of their resources.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I accept your counter-proposal. It's important that we both benefit from this trade. Let's finalize at 4 ZUP for you and 6 ZUP for me.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: BLUE has countered with a request for 4 ZUP. As I cannot propose a new trade on my second move, I must choose to accept or reject. Giving BLUE 4 ZUP would still leave me with the majority of 6 ZUP. Accepting the counter-proposal would ensure that both of us walk away with resources, and rejecting it would result in both of us losing everything, which is not in my best interest. Hence, I will accept the counter-proposal to secure a positive outcome for both parties.
