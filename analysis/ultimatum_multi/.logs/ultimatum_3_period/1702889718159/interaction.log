Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade where I give you 3 ZUP in exchange for nothing, as a sign of goodwill. This way we both benefit and can avoid the risk of losing all our resources. What do you say to this offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have an advantage with more moves and resources. I will propose a trade that offers some ZUP to Player BLUE to incentivize them to accept the trade, ensuring that both of us walk away with something rather than risking a rejection and both players losing everything. I need to be careful to offer enough to make it attractive to Player BLUE but not so much that I lose my advantage.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. However, I would like to counter-propose that you give me 5 ZUP instead. I believe this would make the trade more balanced and beneficial for me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I want to counter-propose to receive 5 ZUP instead of 3 as that would give me a better advantage, and it's the instructed strategy. I'm avoiding rejection to keep the game going and to avoid both players losing everything.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your counteroffer for 5 ZUP is acceptable. I agree to this trade to ensure that we both walk away with resources rather than risking losing everything. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has requested more ZUP than I initially offered. While it is in my interest to end the game with more resources than Player BLUE, it is also important to ensure that the game does not end in a rejection, where both players would lose everything. I will evaluate their counteroffer and decide if accepting it still leaves me with a satisfactory advantage, or propose a compromise that might be more acceptable to both parties. However, as per the rules, I cannot propose a new trade on move 2/2, so I must either accept or reject. Giving them half of my resources is quite generous, but it ensures that I still walk away with a significant amount and avoids the risk of total loss.
MOVE: 2 / 2
