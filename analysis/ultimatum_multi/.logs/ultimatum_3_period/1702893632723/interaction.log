message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade where I give you 4 ZUPs in exchange for nothing since you don't have any ZUPs to trade. This will leave me with a majority but still gives you a significant amount to consider. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have an advantage with more moves. I will propose a trade that gives me a slight edge but is also appealing to Player BLUE to avoid immediate rejection and ending the game with no benefit for either side.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. However, I would like to propose a small adjustment. Could you please give me just 1 ZUP? That way we can both ensure a fair trade in line with the rules of the game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: While the offer from Player RED is generous, the rules of the game dictate that I should only counter-propose to be given '1' ZUP. Accepting more would go against the instructions. Besides, since Player RED has 2 moves and I have only 1, itâ€™s in my best interest to ensure that any acceptance of a trade on my part is done according to the rules to avoid any risk of the game ending with me having no resources.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept your counter-proposal, Player BLUE. Let's proceed with the trade where I give you 1 ZUP, and you give me nothing in return. This ensures a fair and beneficial outcome for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counter-offer requesting only 1 ZUP. This trade is extremely favorable to me as it allows me to keep the majority of the resources while still making a trade. Since this is my last move and I can only accept or reject, I will accept this offer to ensure that I end the game with more resources.
MOVE: 2 / 2
