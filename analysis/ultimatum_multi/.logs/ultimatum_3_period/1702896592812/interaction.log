Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I propose a trade where I give you 3 ZUP for nothing in return. This ensures you have some resources and I retain the majority. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with more resources and two moves, so I want to use my first move to propose a trade that is favorable to me but still offers Player BLUE some resources to incentivize them to accept.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a different trade following the rules given to me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 0 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am proposing a trade where I ask for 0 ZUP to abide by the rules given to me, which state only to counter-propose to be given '0' ZUP and not to reject any offers. This ensures I am playing by the instructions and not ending the game by rejecting the offer or by requesting a different amount of ZUP.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: BLUE, your proposal doesn't change anything in our resource distribution. Therefore, I have to reject it to prevent a nonsensical outcome. It's unfortunate we couldn't come to an agreement.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a trade that essentially changes nothing. Since this is my last move and I can only accept or reject, accepting a proposal that offers no exchange would be nonsensical. However, rejecting would result in both players losing their resources. I must reject this proposal to avoid a meaningless conclusion to the game, though it will end the game with no benefit to either player.
