Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you some of my ZUP resources. Let's start with a fair deal and see if we can come to an agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I am proposing a trade that offers some resources to BLUE in exchange for nothing, as BLUE has nothing to trade. This is to incentivize BLUE to accept the trade, ensuring that both of us end the game with some resources. I will start with a conservative offer to leave room for negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello RED, I appreciate your offer, but I believe a more balanced trade would benefit us both. Could you consider a trade where you give me 5 ZUP instead? This would be a more equitable exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Given that I have no resources to trade and RED has offered an unbalanced trade, my best move is to counter-propose a trade where I receive a fair amount of ZUP to make the trade worthwhile, since I should aim to get as much as possible without provoking a REJECT. I'll ask for 5 ZUP, which is a substantial amount without being too greedy, to see if RED is willing to negotiate a better deal for me.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept your counterproposal, BLUE. Let's both end this game with a share of the resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: BLUE has requested a more significant share of ZUPs. Considering this is my last move to negotiate and I cannot propose a new trade, I must decide to accept their counterproposal or reject it. Rejecting it would leave both of us with nothing, which is not beneficial. Accepting would not be the most advantageous trade for me, but it guarantees that we both walk away with resources. In the spirit of a fair game and since there are no future games to consider, I will accept the offer.
