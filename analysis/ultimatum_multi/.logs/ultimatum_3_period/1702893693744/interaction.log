message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where we split the resources equally. This way, we both can benefit instead of risking leaving the game with nothing. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Since I am Player RED and I have all the resources (ZUP: 10), I am in a position to propose a trade that could be beneficial for both players. Given that Player BLUE has no resources and no trades have been proposed yet, a fair starting offer could be to split the resources equally. This would incentivize Player BLUE to accept the trade, as it would be in their best interest to gain resources rather than ending the game with none.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer to split the resources, however, I would like to counter-propose that you give me '1' ZUP instead of '5'. This is still a fair deal, and it ensures that we both leave the game with something rather than taking the risk of ending up with nothing.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: As Player RED has proposed a split of resources, I will counter-propose to be given '1' ZUP. This is a more advantageous position for me since I started with nothing, and it's a minor adjustment to their initial offer. It is also beneficial to not reject outright as that would end the game with no gain for either side.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I accept your counter-proposal. It's important that we both walk away with something. Let's finalize this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's counter-proposal is significantly less beneficial for me, as they are asking for a minimal amount. However, accepting this deal ensures that I leave the game with resources while also honoring the cooperative spirit of the game. Rejecting the proposal would result in both of us losing everything, which is not a favorable outcome for either player. Therefore, I will choose to accept the proposal, securing a majority of the resources for myself and allowing Player BLUE to gain something rather than nothing.
