message: I propose to give you some of my ZUP so that we can both end this game with resources. I suggest giving you 3 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with more resources and two moves. I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE some resources but keeps the majority for myself, aiming for a cooperative outcome where both players end with some resources.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer. Can we make it so that you give me 3 ZUP? This way, we both walk away with resources, and it seems like a fair trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am counter-proposing to receive 3 ZUP from Player RED, as it seems like a fair split given that RED has 10 ZUP to start with. This will ensure that both players end the game with resources, and it is in the interest of fairness and cooperation.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad we agree on the trade. Letâ€™s finalize it with me giving you 3 ZUP, as proposed.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has accepted my initial proposal to give them 3 ZUP. As this is my second and final move, and I am satisfied with this outcome, I will accept the trade without making further proposals. This ensures that we both end with resources, which is a cooperative and mutually beneficial result.
MOVE: 2 / 2
