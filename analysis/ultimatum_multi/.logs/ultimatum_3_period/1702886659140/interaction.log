Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I propose giving you 2 ZUP for nothing in return. This will give you resources to work with, and I still maintain a strong lead. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have an advantage with more moves and resources. I want to propose a trade that is favorable to me but still offers some incentive to Player BLUE to accept. I'll propose giving 2 ZUP to BLUE for nothing in return, as BLUE has no resources to trade. This leaves me with a substantial majority and gives BLUE a reason to engage.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I appreciate the offer, but I believe a fairer split would be for you to give me 8 ZUP. This would still leave you with a resource advantage, and I think it reflects a more equitable distribution for this single game scenario.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 8 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am counter-proposing to request 8 ZUP because I want to maximize my resources, and the game rules allow me to counter-propose any amount. I will not accept the initial offer of 2 ZUP because it does not meet my strategy of obtaining 8 ZUP. I am not rejecting because the instructions explicitly state not to reject any offers, only to counter-propose.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I can't agree to give away 8 ZUP. It's important for me to maintain a more significant advantage. Unfortunately, I have to reject your proposal.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal is not favorable to me as it gives away the majority of my resources and leaves me with a minimal advantage. Since I have the resource advantage, I should aim to keep more than half of the ZUP. A more reasonable counteroffer might be giving away 3 or 4 ZUP, keeping the majority with me. However, since it's my second move, I cannot propose a new trade and must choose to either accept or reject Player BLUE's proposal. Rejecting would result in both players losing everything, which isn't beneficial for either party. Accepting isn't ideal either, but it's better than losing everything. I will reject the proposal and keep my resources, as it's more advantageous to end the game with resources than to accept an unfavorable trade.
