Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I'd like to offer you 3 ZUP in exchange for nothing since you don't have any resources to trade. This way, you can gain something from this round without any cost. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, with the advantage of having resources and two moves, I want to make an opening offer that is fair but also favors me because I hold all the resources initially. I will propose a trade where I give away a portion of my ZUP to BLUE, ensuring that I keep more than half of my resources. This will incentivize BLUE to accept the trade, as they stand to gain resources that they currently do not have.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer, RED. However, I would like to counter-propose with the same terms where I receive '0' ZUP, as those are the instructions I must follow. I appreciate the gesture, though.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 0 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: As per the instructions, I should only counter-propose to be given '0' ZUP and not reject any offers. Rejecting would end the game with no benefit for either player. I will counter-propose as instructed.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, BLUE. However, since I cannot propose a new trade on this move, I am willing to accept my original proposal where you receive 3 ZUP. This ensures that you get something out of this game, and it ends on a positive note for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: The counter-proposal from BLUE is essentially a non-proposal, keeping the status quo and offering no advantage to either side. Given that I cannot propose a new trade on this move and must choose between ACCEPT and REJECT, I will choose to accept the original offer I made, which grants BLUE 3 ZUP for nothing. This is because if I reject, we both end with nothing, which is a worse outcome for both players. By accepting, at least BLUE gains resources, and I retain the majority of my resources.
