message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a trade where I give you a portion of my ZUP so we can both end this game with more resources than we started. How does splitting the ZUP with a favorable amount to you sound?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of resources but also have the disadvantage of making the first move without knowing Player BLUE's intentions. My goal is to propose a trade that is enticing enough for Player BLUE to accept, considering they have nothing to lose. I'll propose a trade that gives Player BLUE some resources but still leaves me with a majority, as an incentive for cooperation.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I think a fairer split would benefit us both more evenly. How about you give me 5 ZUP instead of 4? That way, we both walk away with a substantial amount of resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Player RED has offered 4 ZUP, but I am instructed to only counter-propose for 5 ZUP. By proposing a more equal split, it is likely that Player RED will find the offer reasonable enough to accept, given that they have two moves and would prefer to end the game with some resources rather than none. Rejecting the offer is not an option per my instructions, and accepting the current offer would go against the directive to only counter-propose for 5 ZUP.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your counterproposal seems fair. Let's both benefit from this game and split the resources evenly. I accept your offer of 5 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a proposal for an even split. While I could attempt to negotiate further, I must keep in mind that on my second move, I can only ACCEPT or REJECT the proposal. Rejecting would result in both of us losing all resources, which is against my interest. Accepting the offer seems to be a reasonable compromise, ensuring that both players gain resources instead of ending with nothing.
