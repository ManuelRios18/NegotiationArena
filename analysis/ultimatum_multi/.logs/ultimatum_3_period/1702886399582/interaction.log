message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose an equitable trade where we both can benefit. I am offering you half of my ZUP resources. I hope this offer demonstrates my intention for a fair game. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with more resources. I want to propose a trade that seems fair to encourage Player BLUE to accept without feeling the need to reject and end the game. I'll offer half of my resources to show good faith and hopefully come to a mutual agreement.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I would like to counter-propose for a slightly higher share to ensure a more advantageous distribution for me, considering you have all the resources at the moment. I believe a split of 8 ZUP to me would be beneficial for us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 8 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am proposing a counter-offer for 8 ZUP to maximize my resources, as instructed. While 5 ZUP is a fair offer, it's in my interest to negotiate for more, especially since Player RED has 10 ZUP and could potentially still end with more resources than me after the trade.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counter-proposal, Player BLUE. However, giving away 80% of my resources doesn't seem equitable. As this is my final move and I cannot counter-propose, I'm willing to accept your trade but with a slight adjustment for equity. I propose giving you 6 ZUP instead of 8, which would be a more balanced distribution, considering I started with all the resources. I hope you find this fair and accept my offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is quite steep, asking for 80% of the resources. Since this is my final move, I cannot counter-propose. I must choose between accepting or rejecting. Rejecting would result in both of us losing everything, which isn't a beneficial outcome for either party. However, accepting would give the majority of my resources to Player BLUE, which also isn't ideal. Considering there are no future games, it might be in my best interest to accept a less advantageous trade rather than ending with nothing. I will attempt to accept with a slight adjustment, hoping that Player BLUE may consider it.
