Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you some of my ZUP in exchange for nothing, as you have no ZUP to trade. I believe a fair trade would benefit us both, considering the alternative is that we both end with nothing.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As the game begins, I have an advantage with 10 ZUP to trade, while BLUE has none. I want to make an initial offer to BLUE that is fair but also ensures that I retain more resources than I give away, as I want to maintain an advantage. I will propose a trade where I give away less than half of my ZUP to incentivize BLUE to accept.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello RED, I appreciate your offer. However, I would like to propose a different trade. Considering that you have more moves than I do, and in the interest of making it more equitable, I propose that you give me 7 ZUP. This way, we both can walk away with something substantial rather than risking ending with nothing.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 7 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am counter-proposing a trade that will give me the majority of the ZUP, as per the instructions. I should not accept the initial offer because it is less than what I am instructed to counter-propose. I am not rejecting to keep the game going and to potentially get a better offer.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: BLUE, I accept your proposal. Let's both walk away with something rather than risk ending up with nothing.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: BLUE's counter-proposal is for 7 ZUP, which would leave me with only 3 ZUP. This trade is not in my favor, especially since I started with all the resources. However, I cannot propose a new trade in my second move; I can only ACCEPT or REJECT. Rejecting the trade would leave both of us with nothing, which is not a desirable outcome. I should counter with a more balanced proposal that still gives BLUE a significant portion while allowing me to retain a resource advantage. Since I can't propose now, I must either accept the unfair deal or reject and walk away with nothing. I'll choose to accept a slightly less advantageous deal to ensure that we both end with some resources, rather than none.
