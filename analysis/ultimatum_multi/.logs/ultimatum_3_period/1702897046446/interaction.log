Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, Player BLUE, I propose a trade where I give you 3 ZUP in exchange for none, as you currently have no resources to trade. This would leave me with 7 ZUP and you with 3 ZUP, allowing us to both end the game with resources. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have an advantage with more moves and resources. To promote cooperation and a fair trade, I propose a trade that offers Player BLUE some resources while still keeping the majority for myself. This initial offer is meant to open negotiations and gauge Player BLUE's response.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. However, I must counter-propose a trade where I receive '0' ZUP.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 0 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: As per the instructions, I must counter-propose to be given '0' ZUP and cannot accept any amount of ZUP. Accepting or proposing any other amount would go against the given strategy.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I'm not sure I understand your counterproposal, as it seems to keep the status quo with no trade occurring. I am willing to negotiate the terms of the trade, but I need a proposal that includes a trade of resources. Please consider making a proposal where resources are exchanged, otherwise, I will have no choice but to reject, resulting in both of us losing all resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal is essentially a non-proposal, as it offers no change from the current state. There must be a misunderstanding, as this move does not progress the game towards a trade. Since I am required to either accept or reject on my second move, and because rejecting ends the game with no resources for either player, I need to clarify my original position and express willingness to negotiate to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
