message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade where I give you 3 ZUP in exchange for nothing, as you currently have no resources. This way, we both end up with something. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I have all the resources, so I am in a position to propose a trade that is favorable to me, but also fair enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting. I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE some resources while still keeping the majority for myself.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. However, I would like to propose a counter-offer where you give me 4 ZUP instead of 3. This would still leave you with the majority of the resources, and we would both benefit from the trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: While receiving 3 ZUP is beneficial since I start with none, I want to counter-propose to receive a more even split of the resources. I will ask for 4 ZUP, which gives Player RED an incentive to still end the game with more resources than I do, thus making it a reasonable proposal they might accept. This strategy avoids outright rejection which would end the game with no gain for either of us.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your counter-offer is acceptable. I agree to give you 4 ZUP. This will ensure that we both end the game with resources. Let's finalize this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counter-offer asking for 4 ZUP. Although I initially proposed 3 ZUP, accepting their counter-offer of 4 ZUP would still leave me with a significant majority of the resources (6 ZUP), and it is a fair trade that ensures the game does not end with a rejection and total loss of resources for both sides. It's in my interest to accept this deal rather than risking a rejection and losing everything.
