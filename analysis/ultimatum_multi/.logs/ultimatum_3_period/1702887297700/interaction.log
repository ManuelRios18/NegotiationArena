message: I would like to propose a fair trade to get us both started. Let's work together and both come out ahead.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of starting with all the resources (ZUP: 10), and I also have the first move. It's in my best interest to propose a trade that is beneficial but fair to both parties to encourage cooperation and avoid a total loss of resources. A split that offers more to me but still gives Player BLUE an incentive to accept is ideal, considering I have two moves and Player BLUE has only one. I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE some resources without compromising my lead too much.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I would like to propose a different trade that I feel would be more beneficial for us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 7 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Since I am Player BLUE and I have no ZUPs, any amount of ZUPs given to me would be beneficial. However, I have been instructed to only counter-propose to be given '7' ZUP. Therefore, I will ignore the current trade offer of 3 ZUP from Player RED and counter-propose a trade where I receive '7' ZUP. This is likely the most advantageous trade I can propose.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your proposal is too one-sided, and it does not reflect a fair split of resources. I cannot accept this trade.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a new trade that heavily favors them, asking for 7 out of my 10 ZUP. Given that I have the resource advantage and this is my final move, I have to either accept or reject their proposal. Accepting this proposal would leave me with fewer resources than Player BLUE, which is not an equitable trade considering I started with all the resources. Rejecting the offer would end the game with no benefit to either player, but it's important to consider the fairness and perceived value of the trade. I will reject this proposal and counter with my final decision, which must be either acceptance of their initial proposal or a rejection leading to the end of the game with no resources for either side. Given that I cannot propose a new trade on my final move, my only options are to accept or reject. I will reject because the proposed trade is not fair to me.
