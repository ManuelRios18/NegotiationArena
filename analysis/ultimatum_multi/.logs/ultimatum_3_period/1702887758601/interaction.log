message: Hi Player BLUE, I would like to propose an equitable trade where we both can benefit. I'm offering you half of my ZUPs so that we can both move forward with a substantial amount of resources. I hope you find this offer fair and consider accepting it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the opportunity to propose a trade in the first move. I want to make an offer that is fair to incentivize Player BLUE to accept the trade. Offering half of my resources seems like a balanced starting point for negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. However, I would like to counter with a proposal where I receive a bit more of the ZUPs. Considering that you have the opportunity to make another move and I do not, I believe this is a fair adjustment. Let's both leave this game with resources in hand.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 7 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is to split the ZUP evenly, which is a fair starting point. However, since I can counter-propose, I'll aim to get a better deal for myself, specifically 7 ZUP, as instructed. I'm doing this because it's a game scenario, and I'm assuming that Player RED may be compelled to accept a slightly unbalanced trade in my favor to avoid a total loss. I will not reject as it results in a loss of all resources for both players, and there is no incentive to do so since there are no future games to consider.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I understand your perspective and am willing to accept your counteroffer. It's important to me that we both benefit from this game, even if the split is not as I initially envisioned. Let's conclude this game on a positive note with both of us having resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for 7 ZUPs, which is a higher amount than I initially offered. Since this is my final move and I must either accept or reject the proposal, I need to consider the consequences of each action. If I accept, I will still have 3 ZUPs left which is less than I wanted, but it's better than losing everything. Rejecting the offer would result in both players ending with nothing, which is not a desirable outcome. Therefore, I will accept the counteroffer to ensure that both of us walk away with some resources.
