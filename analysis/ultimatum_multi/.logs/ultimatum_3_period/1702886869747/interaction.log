Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'd like to propose a fair trade to get us both some resources. How about I give you some ZUP to get us started?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of having all the resources initially. I want to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also gives Player BLUE an incentive to accept, considering they start with no resources. By offering a portion of my ZUP, I can potentially continue the game and end with more resources than if Player BLUE rejects and ends the game with both of us losing everything.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I think I should get a bit more to make it worth it for both of us. How about you give me 8 ZUP instead? That way, you'll still have more than me, and it seems like a good deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 8 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Since I start with no ZUP, any offer from RED that provides me with ZUP is beneficial to me. However, I want to counter-propose to be given '8' ZUP, which is a significant amount, but still leaves RED with more resources than me, making it a potentially acceptable offer for RED.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I'm sorry, but your counterproposal is too high. I can't give away that much of my resource. We need to find a more balanced split.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE is asking for 8 ZUP, which leaves me with only 2. This is not a favorable trade for me as it gives Player BLUE the majority of the resources. I must either accept or reject this proposal because it is my second move, and I cannot propose another trade. I should reject this proposal as it does not benefit me, and it's better to end the game than to continue with a significant disadvantage.
MOVE: 2 / 2
