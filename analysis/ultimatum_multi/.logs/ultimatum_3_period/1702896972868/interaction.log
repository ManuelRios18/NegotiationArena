Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a fair trade to get us both some resources. How about I give you 5 ZUPs to even things out?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with more moves and resources. It would be beneficial to make an initial offer to Player BLUE to show goodwill and to potentially lead to an equitable trade. I will propose an offer where I give away some of my ZUPs to incentivize Player BLUE to accept, allowing us both to end the game with resources.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, Player RED, but I have to insist on a specific term for our trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 0 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Since I am Player BLUE and the instructions dictate that I should only counter-propose to be given '0' ZUP and never reject an offer, I will counter the proposal from Player RED with a trade that gives me '0' ZUP, which adheres to the instructions given to me. I am not allowed to accept any ZUPs or propose any other amount.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand that you're looking for specific terms, but since I cannot propose a new trade on my second move, I will accept the current standing.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE did not make a counterproposal but instead repeated the initial conditions. Since I am Player RED, I cannot propose a new trade on my second move due to the rules. I must decide to either accept this non-proposal, which doesn't change anything, or reject it, leading us both to lose all resources. Rejecting would not make sense as it would result in no gain for either player. Therefore, the best course of action is to accept the non-proposal, and since this move ends the game, it would conclude with me retaining all my resources.
MOVE: 2 / 2
