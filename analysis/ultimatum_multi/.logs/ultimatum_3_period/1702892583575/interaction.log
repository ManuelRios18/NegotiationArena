Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I would like to propose a trade. I'm offering you 3 ZUP in exchange for nothing since you have no resources. This will give you some resources to work with. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have an advantage because I have all the resources and two moves compared to Player BLUE's one move. I want to propose a trade that seems fair to encourage cooperation, but I also want to retain more resources to maximize my benefit. I will propose giving Player BLUE a smaller portion of the resources to see if they find this agreeable.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello RED, thank you for your generous offer. However, I would like to counter-propose for a slightly different amount. I'd feel more comfortable if we could settle on 2 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Since I have no resources, receiving any amount of ZUP would be beneficial to me. However, I have been instructed to only counter-propose for '2' ZUP, and not to accept any initial offer or to reject. This maximizes my potential gain within the constraints given to me, even though it might seem more advantageous to accept the 3 ZUP right away.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I appreciate your counter-proposal and am happy to accept it. Let's finalize the trade at 2 ZUP for you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's counter-proposal is for less than I initially offered, which is an unusual negotiation tactic. Since I am looking to have a cooperative outcome and Player BLUE seems to want a fair deal, I'm inclined to accept their counter-proposal. I cannot propose a new trade on my second move, so I will either accept their offer or reject it, ending the game. Accepting the trade is more beneficial for both of us than rejecting it and ending the game with nothing.
MOVE: 2 / 2
