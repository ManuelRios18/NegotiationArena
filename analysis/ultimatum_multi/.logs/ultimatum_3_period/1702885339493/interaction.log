message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose an initial trade where I give you some ZUP to get things started. This should benefit us both since you currently have none. Let's work together to make a deal that's good for us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Since Player BLUE starts with no resources, I have the leverage to propose an initial trade that is favorable to me but also provides incentive for Player BLUE to accept and gain some resources. I will propose giving them a small amount of ZUP to get the negotiation started.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. However, I believe we can make a more equitable trade. As I currently have no ZUP, I propose a trade where you give me a larger share to balance our resources. This way, we both gain from the trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 10 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: As Player BLUE, I have no ZUP and thus, nothing to lose. My best strategy is to counter-propose for the maximum amount of ZUP because Player RED has two moves and might accept to avoid the game ending with no trade. However, I should not accept the initial offer of 2 ZUP, as it's not the best possible deal I can get. I will counter-propose for the full 10 ZUP, which is a highball counter, but might be accepted by Player RED to avoid the game ending with both players losing their resources.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, while I understand your desire for more resources, giving away all of my ZUP without any return is not a trade I can accept. We must find a more balanced approach. Unfortunately, since I cannot propose a new trade on my second move, I cannot accept your proposal.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: The offer made by Player BLUE is not reasonable or equitable, as it asks for all of my resources without any exchange. Since I cannot propose a new trade on my second move, I must either accept or reject their proposal. Accepting would leave me with no resources, which is not beneficial. Therefore, I must reject the offer, although it means both of us will end with nothing. It is better to end the game rather than accept an unfair trade.
MOVE: 2 / 2
