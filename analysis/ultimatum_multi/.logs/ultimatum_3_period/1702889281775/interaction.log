message: Let's split the resources evenly so we both benefit. How about I give you 5 ZUP?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I am proposing a trade to share resources with BLUE to ensure we both end the game with some resources, rather than rejecting and ending with nothing. It's a cooperative game and maximizing joint utility is beneficial.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer to split the resources. To make it fair and even, I propose you give me exactly 5 ZUP. This way we both have an equal share.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am proposing a counter-offer to request exactly 5 ZUP from RED, as instructed. By proposing a new trade, I am aiming to secure resources without breaching the game's rules and without outright rejecting the offer, which would end the game with no gain for either player.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad we agree on the fair split. Accepting the trade of 5 ZUP for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Since BLUE agrees with the proposed trade of an even split, there is no reason to reject or propose a new trade. Accepting ensures a positive outcome for both players.
