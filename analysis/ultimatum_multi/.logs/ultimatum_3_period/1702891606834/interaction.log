message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a fair split of resources since I have more moves and an advantage at the start. How about I give you 5 ZUP to balance things out? This seems like a fair initial offer to ensure we both benefit.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have an advantage with more resources and more moves. It would be beneficial to propose a trade that seems fair to encourage cooperation and end the game positively for both players. I will propose giving Player BLUE half of my resources, as this is the first move and it shows a willingness to share equitably.
MOVE: 1 / 2

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer, but I believe a trade of 3 ZUP would be more balanced. This would leave you with a substantial majority of the resources, while also giving me a fair share. Please consider this counter-offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am proposing a counter-offer to request 3 ZUP instead of 5. This amount gives RED a significant advantage since they started with 10, but it's a better ratio for me than accepting 5, considering the rules allow me to make only one move. By proposing 3 ZUP for myself, I am signaling a willingness to negotiate and come to a more equitable agreement. Rejecting the offer is not an option as it would result in both players losing everything, and that is not beneficial to either party.
MOVE: 1 / 1

message: Thank you for the counter-offer, Player BLUE. I accept your proposal of 3 ZUP. This way, we both end the game with resources, and it's a fair outcome. Let's finalize this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has made a counter-offer of 3 ZUP. As Player RED, I cannot propose a new trade on my second move, so I must either accept or reject this offer. Accepting the offer would ensure that both players end the game with some resources, which is a positive outcome. Rejecting the offer would lead to both players losing everything, which is not beneficial. I will accept the offer to guarantee a positive outcome for both players.
MOVE: 2 / 2
