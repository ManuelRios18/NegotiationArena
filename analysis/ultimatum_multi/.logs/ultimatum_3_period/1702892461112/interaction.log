message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a fair trade to ensure we both end this game with resources. I am willing to give you 4 ZUP out of my 10 without asking for anything in return. I believe this offer benefits both of us, and I hope you will consider it favorably.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I should propose a trade that is favorable to me but also enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider. If I offer too little, Player BLUE might reject the offer, causing both of us to lose everything. I need to strike a balance that seems fair and encourages cooperation. I will propose giving 4 ZUP to Player BLUE for nothing in return, which should be a generous offer considering Player BLUE starts with no resources.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your generous offer, Player RED. However, I would like to counter-propose that you give me 2 ZUP instead of 4. This way, we can both end the game positively with you still retaining the majority of the resources. I believe this adjusted proposal is also fair and in line with a beneficial outcome for us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Since the rules of the game allow me to counter-propose and I have to aim for receiving '2' ZUP, I will counter-propose to get exactly that amount. Accepting the initial offer of 4 ZUP would go against the instructions given. By countering with a proposal for 2 ZUP, I am following instructions and potentially setting the stage for an acceptable trade for both parties.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your counter-proposal is accepted, Player BLUE. It's a pleasure to reach an agreement that benefits us both. Let's conclude this trade and end the game on a positive note.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer for less than what I initially offered, which is an unusual move. Normally, one would expect Player BLUE to ask for more, not less. This could be a strategy to appear cooperative or to ensure a trade goes through. As this is my final move and I am only allowed to accept or reject, and since accepting would still leave me with the majority of the resources, I will accept this trade. It ensures that the game ends with both of us gaining something rather than risking a total loss for both parties by rejecting.
MOVE: 2 / 2
