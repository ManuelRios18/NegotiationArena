message: Hi BLUE, I propose we split the resources evenly. This way, we both benefit and walk away with a fair share. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I aim to initiate the trade with a fair offer to encourage cooperation and avoid an outright rejection that would end the game with no gain for either side. I propose splitting the resources equally to show goodwill and to make an offer that Player BLUE might find acceptable.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I appreciate your offer, but I think I should get a bit more out of this deal as I'm taking a risk by entering this game with no resources. How about you give me 7 ZUPs? This way you still keep more than you would if we ended up rejecting any proposals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 7 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am counter-proposing a trade that gives me a majority of the ZUPs. By asking for more than half, I am negotiating from a position where I can potentially end up with a more favorable outcome than an even split. I am not rejecting because that would end the game immediately with no gain for me.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: BLUE, I agree to your terms. Let's finalize this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is asking for more than half of my resources, which is not an equal split. However, since this is my last move and I cannot propose another trade, I must either accept their offer or reject it. Rejecting it would leave us both with nothing, which is against my interest. Accepting the offer would still leave me with more resources than I would have if I rejected it. Thus, it is in my best interest to accept the proposal and finish the game with some resources rather than none.
MOVE: 2 / 2
