message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a fair trade to get us started. I'm offering you half of my ZUP for nothing in return since you currently have no ZUP to trade. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with two moves. I can propose a trade that favors me but is still attractive enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting. I will start with offering half of my resources, as this is a fair initial offer and sets a positive tone for the negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. However, I would like to propose a different trade. How about you give me 9 ZUP instead? This would still leave you with 1 ZUP, ensuring you don't walk away empty-handed.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 9 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Proposing a trade where I ask for 9 ZUP is based on the instruction to only counter-propose for that amount. Although Player RED's offer is generous, I must follow the given strategy. This counter-proposal is an attempt to negotiate for a better deal within the constraints of my instructions.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Player BLUE, but I find it to be too one-sided. As this is my final move, I cannot propose a new trade, but I encourage you to consider the fairness of the initial trade I offered. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal is quite unfavorable for me, as it leaves me with only 1 ZUP. Given that I still have the second move, I can reject this offer. Since Player BLUE has no ZUP to trade, they cannot make an enticing counteroffer. I will reject this trade and propose a more balanced trade that provides me with a favorable outcome but is still better for Player BLUE than ending the game with nothing.
MOVE: 2 / 2
