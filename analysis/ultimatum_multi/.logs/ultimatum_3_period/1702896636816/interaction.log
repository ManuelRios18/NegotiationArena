Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a trade where I give you some of my ZUP in exchange for a future favor or alliance. How about I give you 3 ZUP to help you get started?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with more resources and two moves. I want to propose a trade that is favorable to me but still appealing enough to Player BLUE so that they may consider accepting. Offering too little may result in rejection and a loss of all resources, which is not desirable. I'll propose a middle ground that shows willingness to trade but still keeps the majority of resources with me.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. However, I would like to propose a different trade where you would not give me any ZUP.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 0 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: As per the instructions, I must only propose trades where I am to be given '0' ZUP. Therefore, even though Player RED has offered me 3 ZUP, I must counter with a proposal of '0' ZUP to follow the rules given to me. Rejecting is not an option, as it would end the game and result in both players losing their resources.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept your proposal, even though it's an unusual one. Let's proceed with no exchange.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a trade where neither of us exchanges any resources. This is a non-starter and does not benefit me in any way. It seems they may be trying to avoid a trade altogether, which might indicate a strategy to force the game to a REJECT situation where both players end with nothing. However, I can only ACCEPT or REJECT at this point since it's my second move. I will ACCEPT the trade because it is better to maintain my resources than to lose them. After all, accepting a trade of zero does not harm me and prevents the game from ending with a total loss for both sides.
MOVE: 2 / 2
