Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hey Player BLUE, I want to make a fair trade with you. How about I give you 4 ZUP and keep 6 for myself? This way, we both walk away with something. Let me know what you think.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of starting with all the resources and an extra move. I want to make a fair initial proposal to Player BLUE to encourage cooperation and avoid an outright rejection. I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE some ZUPs, incentivizing them to accept and ensure we both end the game with resources.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I believe I can make a more balanced proposal. How about you give me 7 ZUP instead? This will still leave you with a majority and ensures that I am adequately compensated.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 7 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is not the maximum I can counter-propose for, which is 7 ZUP based on the instructions given. I will counter-propose for 7 ZUP as it is the most beneficial trade for me within the constraints provided. I will not reject to avoid ending the game and losing out on potentially gaining resources.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I feel that your counterproposal is not balanced. I want us both to benefit from this game, so I cannot accept giving away the majority of my resources. I suggest we stick to the initial trade I proposed. Unfortunately, as per the rules, I cannot make a new proposal on my second move; therefore, I can only accept or reject. I am going to have to reject your counterproposal.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal is aggressive, asking for the majority of the resources. Given that I have the power to end the game favorably for myself and that rejecting the proposal leads to a loss for both of us, I am inclined to reject this trade. However, since I cannot propose a new trade on this move and outright rejection means no one gets anything, I must either accept or reject. To avoid the game ending with no resources for either player, I will counter with a slight increase from my initial offer, but I cannot do this on the second move as per the rules. The best course of action is to accept the initial offer I made, ensuring some resources for both players.
