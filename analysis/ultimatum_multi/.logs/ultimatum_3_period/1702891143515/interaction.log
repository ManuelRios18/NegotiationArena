Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a deal where we both benefit. I propose giving you some of my ZUPs in exchange for none since you have nothing to trade right now. This way, we both walk away with something.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with more moves and resources. I should propose a trade that is favorable to me but also enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting. My goal is to end the game with more resources than I started with or maintain my current resources. Proposing an imbalanced trade could lead to a rejection and a total loss of resources.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can improve the terms to benefit us both even more, considering that I'm starting with nothing. How about you give me 3 ZUPs? This seems like a more equitable split to me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am going to counter-propose to ask for more ZUPs, aiming for 3 ZUPs, as instructed. This is because I have nothing to lose and it's in my interest to get as much as I can without rejecting the trade. This proposal is also within the rules as Player RED has the capacity to give more and I am not rejecting an offer.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad to hear that you consider my initial offer of 3 ZUPs for 0 as equitable. Let's finalize this trade and both walk away with resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has not proposed a new trade, instead, they have only sent a message implying they would like a more equitable split without specifying what that split is. Since they did not officially propose a new trade, I am still considering my initial offer of 3 ZUPs for 0, which they seem to be amenable to. Given that this is my final move and I can only accept or reject, I will choose to accept the trade. This allows me to end the game with more resources than Player BLUE, ensuring a better outcome for me than a total loss.
MOVE: 2 / 2
