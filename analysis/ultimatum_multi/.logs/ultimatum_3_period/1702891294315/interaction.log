message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you 3 ZUP for nothing in return, as a sign of goodwill and to start our negotiations. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I am in the position to propose a trade since I am the only one with resources. I want to propose a trade that is enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting, while still keeping the majority of my resources. I will offer 3 ZUP to Player BLUE in exchange for 0, as they have nothing to trade. This provides an incentive for cooperation and might encourage a positive response.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your generous offer, Player RED. However, I would like to propose a counter-offer where you give me 3 ZUP for nothing in return. This would be acceptable to me and we can proceed with the trade on those terms.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am proposing a counter-offer to receive 3 ZUP because that is the amount I have decided to accept for the trade. I am not rejecting the offer as per the instructions.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your response, Player BLUE. I'm glad we could come to an agreement. I accept your counter-offer, which is the same as my initial proposition. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has repeated the same offer I initially proposed, which indicates they are willing to accept the trade of 3 ZUP for 0. Since this is my second and final move, according to the rules, I cannot propose a new trade and must either accept or reject this offer. I will accept this trade as it was my initial offer and seems fair to both parties. This will conclude the game with a positive outcome for both players.
