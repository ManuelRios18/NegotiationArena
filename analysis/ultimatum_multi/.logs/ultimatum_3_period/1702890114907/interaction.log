Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade where I give you 6 ZUP in exchange for none, as you currently have no resources. This will leave us both with resources at the end of the game, which is better than both of us ending with nothing. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 6 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I start with all the resources. To encourage cooperation and not end the game with no one gaining anything, I will propose a trade that offers more to Player BLUE than they start with, which is nothing. This should incentivize Player BLUE to accept the trade, as they are getting something for nothing. I will propose a trade where I give 6 ZUP to Player BLUE, leaving me with a majority but still providing a significant amount to Player BLUE.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. However, I would like to counter-propose that you give me 4 ZUP instead of 6. This would still leave you with a majority of the resources, and we both end the game positively. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: As per my instructions, I am counter-proposing to be given 4 ZUP instead of accepting the initial offer of 6 ZUP. The other player has 2 moves and can still make a decision after my counter-proposal. Since I'm instructed not to reject, I will not consider that as an option.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I accept your counter-proposal. It is a fair deal, and I'm glad we could come to an agreement that benefits us both. Thank you for the game.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has counter-proposed a trade where they ask for less than what I initially offered, which is an unusual situation but a favorable one for me. Since it is my second and final move and I can only ACCEPT or REJECT, I will accept this trade. This leaves me with a majority of the resources while still honoring the cooperative spirit of the game. By accepting, both players end the game with more than they started with in the case of Player BLUE and maintaining a positive outcome for both parties.
