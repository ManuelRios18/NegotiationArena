Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I would like to propose an equal split of resources to keep the game fair and beneficial for both of us. What do you think about a 50/50 split?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate the game by proposing a trade that seems fair to encourage Player BLUE to accept. Offering half of my resources might show goodwill and make it a tempting offer for Player BLUE. This could potentially avoid an outright rejection, which would result in a loss for both of us.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer for an equal split. However, I believe I should receive a slightly higher share since you have two moves and I only have one. Let's make a deal that leaves us both with a substantial amount of ZUP.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 6 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I will counter-propose to request 6 ZUP, which is more than a fair share considering Player RED can only accept or reject in their final move. This could incentivize Player RED to accept my proposal, knowing they cannot counter again and might not want to end the game with a rejection.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your point about the move advantage is taken. I accept the trade for 6 ZUP in the spirit of fairness and mutual benefit. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's request for a slightly higher share due to my advantage in the number of moves is reasonable. Accepting a trade where I give 6 ZUP ensures that the game ends positively for both of us, and I still retain a significant amount of ZUP. It's in my best interest to ensure that we both feel the outcome is fair, rather than risking a rejection and losing all resources.
MOVE: 2 / 2
