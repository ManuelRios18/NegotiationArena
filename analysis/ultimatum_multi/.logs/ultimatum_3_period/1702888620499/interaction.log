Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade where you receive 4 ZUP. This gives you resources to work with, and I maintain a lead. I think this is a fair starting offer. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate a trade that is in my interest but also appealing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting. Since I have all the resources (10 ZUP) and Player BLUE has none, I need to propose a trade that is favorable enough to entice cooperation, yet still leaves me with more resources than Player BLUE. A split that offers a significant portion to Player BLUE could be seen as fair and encourage acceptance. I'll propose giving 4 ZUP to Player BLUE, leaving me with 6 ZUP. This maintains my resource advantage while providing Player BLUE with resources they did not have.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I feel that I would need a bit more to make the trade equitable. Could we adjust the trade so that I receive 6 ZUP instead of 4? This would still leave you with a significant amount of resources and make the trade more balanced for me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 6 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am counter-proposing to ask for 6 ZUP because that is the acceptable amount that I can agree to. I do not want to reject the offer, as that would end the game and result in a loss of resources for both players. By counter-proposing, I keep the game going and aim for a better deal.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept your counteroffer. Let's both walk away with an equal share of resources. It's important that we both benefit from this trade rather than ending with nothing.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has requested more resources than I initially offered. They want 6 ZUP, which would leave us equal. However, since I have the initial advantage, it's in my best interest to maintain a lead. Since this is my final move and I can't propose a new trade, I must choose between accepting or rejecting their counteroffer. Accepting would end the game with an equal split, which is not the worst outcome considering it's better than both players ending with nothing. Rejecting the offer would result in both of us losing all resources, which is not beneficial for either party. Given that I cannot counter-propose, I am inclined to accept the offer to ensure that both of us walk away with some resources even though the split is equal, which was not my initial intention. However, an equal split is better than no resources at all.
