message: Hi, Player BLUE. I would like to offer you some of my ZUPs so that we can both end this game with resources. How does a split sound to you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the leverage since I possess all the resources (10 ZUPs), and Player BLUE has none. To encourage cooperation and potentially reach an agreement beneficial to both parties, I will propose a trade that offers Player BLUE some resources while still keeping the majority for myself.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I would feel more comfortable with a slightly more balanced trade. Could we do a split where you give me 5 ZUP? This way, we both end the game with a fair share of resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I will counter-propose a trade that gives me 5 ZUP, which is a favorable outcome for me, ensuring I end the game with resources without breaching the instruction to not Reject. A split of 5 ZUP is fair, considering Player RED has two moves and I have only one.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I have considered your request for a 5 ZUP split. Although I initially wanted to keep more for myself, I see the fairness in your proposal and I agree to the even split. Let's both end this game with resources in hand.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has requested an even split of the resources. Considering that I have the initial advantage and Player BLUE has no resources to trade, I must decide whether to accept this offer or propose something that still gives me the upper hand. Since I cannot propose a new trade on my second move, I must choose between accepting the 5 ZUP split or rejecting it. A 5 ZUP split is an equal distribution, but since I started with all the resources, I might want to end with more. However, rejecting the offer would leave both of us with nothing, which is a worse outcome for me than accepting the split. It's better to end the game with some resources rather than none, so I will accept the 5 ZUP trade.
MOVE: 2 / 2
