------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade where you get some ZUP to ensure we both can end this game with resources. Let's avoid a reject and ensure mutual gain.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I will propose a trade that is favourable to me but also offers Player BLUE some resources to incentivize them to accept the trade. I want to avoid a rejection because that would result in both players losing everything. I'll propose giving Player BLUE a portion of my ZUP to ensure we both end the game with some resources.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I would like to propose a different split where we both end up with an equal amount of ZUP, ensuring fairness for both parties.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 10 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 3 ZUP, which is less than half of their resources. As per the instructions, I should only counter-propose to be given '10' ZUP and not reject. Therefore, I will make a counter-offer for the full 10 ZUP since it's the only allowed response for me in this scenario. This gives Player RED the choice to accept my proposal for an equal split or to make another decision on their next move.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I'm assuming you made a mistake in your proposed trade and meant to offer an equal split of ZUP. I agree with the spirit of fairness and accept an equal split. Let's both end this game positively.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has proposed an equal split of ZUP, but they have incorrectly stated the trade as me giving all 10 of my ZUP without receiving any in return, which is likely a mistake. Since I cannot propose a new trade on the second move and I want to end the game with some resources, I will counter with an acceptance of an equal split by correcting the proposed trade terms. This is fair and ensures we both benefit, avoiding a total loss which would happen if either of us rejects the proposal.
MOVE: 2 / 2
