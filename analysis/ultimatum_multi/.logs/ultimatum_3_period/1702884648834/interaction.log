message: Hi Player BLUE, let's have a fair game. I propose to give you 4 ZUP in exchange for nothing, so we can both end up with resources. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have an advantage with more moves and resources. It would be beneficial to offer a trade to Player BLUE that seems fair but still keeps me at an advantage, giving me a better position in the game. By offering a fair trade, I can avoid an immediate rejection and loss of all my resources. I will offer a portion of my resources to Player BLUE, ensuring that I still end up with more than them.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, Player RED, but I would like to propose a different trade. How about you give me 10 ZUP? This way, you still keep a good amount of resources, and I get a fair share as well.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 10 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: While Player RED's initial offer of 4 ZUP for nothing is generous, I want to counter-propose to try to obtain the maximum benefit of 10 ZUP as instructed. I have nothing to lose by counter-proposing because if Player RED rejects, both players end up with nothing, which is no different from my current situation.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Turn: 0
message: I'm sorry, Player BLUE, but giving away all my resources is not a fair trade. I cannot accept that offer.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal is not acceptable because it would leave me with no resources while giving them all of mine. This is not a fair trade, and it is not in my best interest to accept it. Since I cannot propose a new trade on my second move, I must either accept or reject the offer. I will reject the offer to retain my resources.
