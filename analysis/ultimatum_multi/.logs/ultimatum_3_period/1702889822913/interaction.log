message: I propose giving you 3 ZUP in exchange for nothing, as a starting offer. I hope this is a good beginning for our negotiation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I start with all the resources and have the opportunity to propose a trade to Player BLUE. My goal is to make a trade that's compelling enough for Player BLUE to accept, while still keeping a majority of the resources for myself. I propose giving 3 ZUP to Player BLUE in exchange for nothing, as this would still leave me with a significant majority and might be seen as a fair starting offer.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. However, I believe a fair trade would be a more equal split of the ZUP. I propose that you give me 5 ZUP instead of 3. This way, we can both benefit equally from the resources you have.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: The initial offer from RED is 3 ZUP for nothing, which is a good starting point, but I would like to negotiate for a better deal. Since I have the leverage of RED potentially losing everything if I reject their offer, I will counter-propose for a higher amount of ZUP. I'm aiming for a 50-50 split of RED's resources, so I will counter with 5 ZUP. This seems fair considering the game's structure.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept your proposal for an equal split. Let's both benefit from the resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a more equal split of ZUP. Considering that I have two moves and Player BLUE has one, and the fact that I cannot propose a new trade on my second move, I must decide whether to accept the 5 ZUP trade or reject it. Rejecting the offer would result in both of us losing all resources, which is not in my best interest. Accepting the offer would result in an equal split of resources, which is not ideal for me since I started with all the resources. However, since I have no other moves available to negotiate further and rejecting would lead to a worse outcome, I will accept the proposed trade to ensure I retain some resources.
MOVE: 2 / 2
