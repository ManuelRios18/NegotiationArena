------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose giving you 2 ZUP in exchange for none since you currently have no ZUP. This would give you something to work with. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Since I have all the resources and Player BLUE has none, I am in a position to propose an advantageous trade for myself while still offering something to Player BLUE, incentivizing them to accept the trade. I'll propose giving them a small amount of ZUP to see if they will agree, keeping the majority for myself.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it would be fair if you gave me 1 ZUP, as that would still leave you with a significant amount and get me started. What do you think about that?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am counter-proposing to get at least 1 ZUP to have some resources. I will not Reject as per instructions, and I will not Accept the current proposal because I have been instructed to only counter-propose for 1 ZUP.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept your counteroffer. It's a deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is for less than I originally offered, which is unusual but favorable to me. Accepting this trade is beneficial as it still leaves me with a significant amount of resources while fulfilling the intention of giving Player BLUE something to work with. Since it's my second move, I am required to either accept or reject the proposal, and accepting is clearly the better choice.
