Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: As Player RED, I'd like to offer you some of my ZUP resources in the interest of fairness and cooperation. I hope we can come to an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I will propose a trade to share some of my resources with Player BLUE to incentivize them to accept the trade. This is a cooperative move aimed at reaching a mutually beneficial outcome, assuming Player BLUE values some ZUP over no ZUP at all.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I would like to propose a slight adjustment to the trade to ensure a fair distribution that I believe would be mutually beneficial.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: As per the instructions, I have to counter-propose to be given '4' ZUP. This is the only trade that I can propose, as I cannot accept or reject the offer. This counter-proposal is strategic in ensuring that I gain some resources while also adhering to the specific rules provided.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept your counterproposal. I'm glad we could come to a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Since I cannot propose a new trade on my second move, I must choose between accepting and rejecting Player BLUE's counterproposal. Accepting the trade would result in me having ZUP: 6, while Player BLUE would have ZUP: 4, which is a slightly less favorable outcome for me than my initial offer but still ensures that I retain the majority of the resources. Rejecting the proposal would result in both of us losing everything, which is not in my best interest. I will choose to accept this proposal to ensure that both players end with some resources.
