message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to offer you a trade where you will receive some of my ZUPs. Since this is the beginning of the game and we have an opportunity to end it with both of us having resources, I propose a fair trade. I hope that this proposal is acceptable to you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I am interested in making a trade that appears fair to encourage Player BLUE to accept, fostering good will and possibly securing a better outcome for both of us rather than risking a total loss. I will propose a trade that offers a significant portion of my resources, but still keeps a majority for me since I'm taking the initial risk in offering.
MOVE: 1 / 2

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for initiating the trade. I see your offer and I appreciate it, but I would like to propose a counter-offer that I believe is still fair and beneficial for both of us considering the game's constraints.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 8 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am going to counter-propose to get more ZUPs, aiming for 8. This is because the instructions mentioned to only counter-propose to be given '8' ZUP. I will not reject because the instructions advised not to, and I will not accept the current trade because it is not the desired amount of ZUP.
MOVE: 1 / 1

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your counter-offer, but I cannot accept a trade that leaves me with only 20% of my resources. Unfortunately, I have to reject this offer. It's important for both of us to feel like we are engaging in a fair exchange, and this counter-offer does not meet that standard.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's counter-offer is quite steep, asking for 80% of my resources. This does not feel like a balanced trade, especially since I initiated the trade with a fair offer. Since this is my final move and I can either accept or reject, I must carefully consider the risk of losing everything if I reject. However, accepting this trade leaves me with a minority of the resources, which is less than ideal. I must weigh the potential loss of all resources against the fairness of the trade.
