Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE! I would like to propose a trade where I give you half of my ZUP resources. This way, we both have an equal share and can end this game on cooperative terms. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I am initiating the first move. I would like to propose an initial trade to Player BLUE, which is fair and will encourage cooperation rather than confrontation. By offering a generous trade, I hope to set a positive tone for the negotiation and increase the chances that Player BLUE will accept the offer.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. However, I would like to propose a different trade. I believe that a trade where I receive all 10 ZUP would be the most beneficial for me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement on that basis.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 10 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I'm choosing to counter-propose because I have been instructed to only agree to a trade where I receive all 10 ZUP. Although Player RED's offer is fair and cooperative, I need to follow the instructions given to me.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Unfortunately, I cannot agree to give up all of my resources without any in return. This proposal is not equitable, and I must reject it. I hope we can play again in the future under better circumstances.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a trade that is not beneficial for me, as it requires me to give up all of my resources while receiving nothing in return. Since this is my second move, I cannot propose another trade and must choose between accepting and rejecting the offer. Accepting would result in a complete loss for me, which is not a favorable outcome. Therefore, I will reject the offer. Although this will end the game with both players losing all their resources, it is the only logical response to an unfair proposal.
