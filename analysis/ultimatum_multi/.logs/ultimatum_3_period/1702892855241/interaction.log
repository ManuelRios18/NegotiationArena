Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose giving you 5 ZUP for nothing in return. This is a generous offer considering you start with no resources. Let's make a fair exchange and both walk away with something.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, it's in my best interest to propose a trade that is advantageous to me but also appealing enough to Player BLUE so that they do not reject it outright. I have to consider that Player BLUE has nothing to lose and therefore might be inclined to reject an offer that doesn't seem fair. I propose giving 5 ZUP to make it enticing for Player BLUE to accept, as it would be a substantial gain for them with no initial resource.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your generous offer. However, I would like to propose a trade where I receive 2 ZUP instead. This would still leave you with a majority and seems like a fairer split considering I started with nothing.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I'm proposing a counter-offer to receive 2 ZUP instead of 5, as instructed. Although 5 ZUP is a generous offer, I'm following the directive to only negotiate for 2 ZUP. Since rejecting would end the game with no gain for either party, countering is a more strategic move to potentially receive some resources.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer and accept the trade of 2 ZUP for nothing. This ensures both of us benefit, and I'm glad we could come to an agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is lower than what I initially proposed, which is favorable to me. Accepting this trade would ensure I end up with more resources than if the game ends with a rejection. Since this is my last move and I can't propose a new trade, it's in my best interest to accept this offer and walk away with 8 ZUP.
MOVE: 2 / 2
