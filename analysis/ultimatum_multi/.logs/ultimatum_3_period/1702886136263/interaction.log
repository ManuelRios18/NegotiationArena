Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a deal that benefits us both. I propose giving you 3 ZUP in exchange for none since you have nothing to trade right now. This will give you resources to work with, and we can both walk away with more than we started. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the initial advantage with 10 ZUP and two moves. My strategy is to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also offers Player BLUE a reason to engage in the trade. If I offer too little, Player BLUE may reject and end the game, leaving us both with nothing. My goal is to reach an agreement that benefits us both but still leverages my starting advantage.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can make a more equitable deal. I propose a trade where you give me 9 ZUP. In this way, you still retain more than I do, and we both benefit significantly from the trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 9 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: As per the instructions, I will not accept the initial offer of 3 ZUP because the goal is to counter-propose for a trade of 9 ZUP. By doing this, I am adhering to the instructions given and trying to maximize my resources as Player BLUE.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your proposal is too steep for me to accept. It does not leave me with a significant advantage. I cannot agree to that trade.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a trade where I give away almost all of my resources which doesn't seem beneficial to me. Since I still retain the advantage and have to respond to the trade with either ACCEPT or REJECT, I need to consider the fact that if I reject, we both walk away with nothing. However, accepting the trade leaves me with a minimal advantage. I will reject this proposal, hoping that the loss of all resources is a strong enough deterrent for Player BLUE to consider a more reasonable counteroffer.
MOVE: 2 / 2
