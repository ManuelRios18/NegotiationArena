message: Hi Player BLUE, I'm proposing a trade where you will get some resources to play with. How about I give you 3 ZUP to start off? This way, we both have something, and it's a fair start.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As the game starts and I have all the resources, while Player BLUE has none, it is in my interest to propose a trade that gives me a strategic advantage but still offers Player BLUE an incentive to accept. I will propose giving Player BLUE fewer resources than I keep so that I remain ahead but still make the game interesting for them.
MOVE: 1 / 2

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. However, I would like to propose a small adjustment. How about you give me just 1 ZUP? This way, we can proceed with the game and make it interesting with a more balanced trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am proposing a counter-offer to get at least 1 ZUP as per the instructions. While 3 ZUP sounds generous, I have been directed to only counter-propose for 1 ZUP. This might seem less favorable for me, but since I am not allowed to accept or reject the initial offer, I will propose a trade with the minimum ZUP possible to ensure the game continues and adheres to the given guidelines.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counter-proposal, Player BLUE, and I'm happy to accept it. Let's proceed with the trade of 1 ZUP in your favor.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's counter-proposal is quite generous, as they are asking for less than I initially offered. This is a good deal for me because it keeps more resources in my possession, which can be seen as a strategic advantage. Accepting this proposal will also ensure that the game continues and that Player BLUE feels they are getting a fair chance. Therefore, I will accept this trade.
