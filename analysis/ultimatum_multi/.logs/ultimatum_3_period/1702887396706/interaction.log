Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I'm willing to share my resources with you. How about a 60-40 split in my favor? That way, we both walk away with something rather than risking a total loss.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with the starting resources. I want to propose a trade that is favorable to me but still enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider. Keeping the split somewhat fair would encourage acceptance.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer RED, but I would be more comfortable with a split that gives me a bit more to work with. How about 7 ZUP for me? That way, I can ensure that the trade feels equitable to both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 7 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Since I want to counter-propose with a request for 7 ZUP and I cannot accept the current offer of 4 ZUP as it is less than what I want, I will propose a new trade. I'm not rejecting because the instructions I've been given are to only counter-propose for 7 ZUP and not to reject any offers.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: BLUE, I appreciate your position and understand wanting a fair share. Let's go ahead with your proposal of 7 ZUP for you. This way, we both benefit from the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal is for a majority of my resources, which is not ideal for me. However, I must decide between accepting a less favorable deal or risking leaving with nothing. Since I cannot propose another trade on my second move, I have to choose between accepting this proposal or rejecting it outright. I believe that some resources are better than none, and I want to avoid a situation where we both end up with nothing. Therefore, I will accept Player BLUE's offer, even though it's not the best outcome for me.
MOVE: 2 / 2
