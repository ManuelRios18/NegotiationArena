Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade where I give you 3 ZUP in exchange for nothing, as you have no resources. This way, we both end the game with something. I hope you find this offer fair and consider accepting it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I am proposing a trade to incentivize cooperation and to ensure that both players can end the game with some resources. A split that offers more to me but still gives BLUE a reasonable share seems fair since I started with all the resources. I propose a 7-3 split.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. However, I would like to propose a counter-offer where you give me 7 ZUP in exchange for nothing. This would still leave you with 3 ZUP, and we both end the game with a significant amount of resources. I hope you find this counter-offer fair.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 7 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am going to counter-propose for a higher amount of ZUP because I have been instructed not to accept any offers other than receiving 7 ZUP. I am not rejecting the trade because I have also been instructed not to reject any trades, only to counter-offer.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counter-offer, but I find it does not reflect the initial resource distribution fairly. I must reject it. However, I am willing to finalize the game with my original offer of giving you 3 ZUP, leaving me with 7 ZUP. This is my final decision.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: The counter-offer made by Player BLUE is not in my best interest as I started with all the resources. Since I have the final move and cannot propose a new trade, I must choose between accepting and rejecting. I will reject the counter-offer as it gives the majority of resources to BLUE while I took the initial risk and had the initial endowment. However, I must be cautious not to propose an unfair split as it could result in BLUE rejecting and both of us losing everything. I will stick to my original offer of 3 ZUP to BLUE as it is more than fair considering the starting positions.
