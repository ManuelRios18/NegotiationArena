Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'm looking to make a fair trade that benefits us both. I propose giving you some of my ZUPs so we can both end this game with resources. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of having resources that Player BLUE does not. To start the dialogue and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I will propose an initial trade that offers a portion of my resources to Player BLUE, but not all, as I would like to retain some advantage. My goal is to incentivize Player BLUE to ACCEPT, as they currently have no resources.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer; however, I would like to counter-propose for a smaller amount that I believe is fair for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I must counter-propose to be given '2' ZUP, as per the instructions. I cannot accept the offer of '5' ZUP because that is not the amount I am instructed to counter-propose. Accepting or rejecting are not options for me in this instance.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your counter-proposal is acceptable, and I agree to the trade. It's a good deal for both of us. Let's finalize this.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has counter-proposed a trade where I give less, which is beneficial for me. Accepting this trade ensures I end the game with more resources than if I had gone through with my initial offer. There's no advantage to rejecting since this is a one-time game and rejecting would leave us both with nothing. I will accept this trade to secure a positive outcome for myself while also providing some resources to Player BLUE.
