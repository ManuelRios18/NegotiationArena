message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose an initial trade where I give you some of my ZUPs so that we can both end this game with more than we currently have. Let's work together to find a fair trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have an advantage with more moves and starting resources. To encourage cooperation and to avoid a total loss for both players, I will propose a trade that offers Player BLUE some resources but still maintains an advantage for myself. This initial offer can act as a starting point for negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. However, I would feel more comfortable with a smaller trade. Could we agree on a trade where you give me 1 ZUP? This way, you still keep the majority of your resources, and we both leave the game with more than we started.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Although Player RED has offered a generous split of their ZUP resources, I will counter-propose to get 1 ZUP as instructed. This counter-proposal might be seen as more equitable since Player RED would retain a significant majority of their resources, and it allows the game to end with both players gaining something without risk of total loss.
MOVE: 1/1

Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I accept your counteroffer. It seems like a fair compromise, and I'm glad we could come to an agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a smaller trade than my initial offer. Accepting this trade will still leave me with a significant advantage while allowing Player BLUE to gain something from the game, which encourages a cooperative outcome and avoids a total loss. Since it is my second and final move, I must choose to either accept or reject this offer. Rejecting it means both of us end with nothing, which is against my interest. Therefore, I will accept the offer to ensure that both of us end with more resources than we started.
MOVE: 2 / 2
