Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I am proposing a trade where you will receive some ZUPs, this way we both can end this game with resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with 2 moves against Player BLUE's single move, and I start with all the resources. Since there are no future games, my goal is to end this game with as much of my resource intact as possible while giving Player BLUE an incentive to accept a trade. I will propose an initial trade that gives Player BLUE some resources, but still keeps the majority for myself.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a counter-offer where I receive a fairer share of the ZUPs.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 6 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am counter-proposing to ask for more ZUPs because I want to end the game with the agreed-upon amount of 6 ZUPs if possible. This will give me a better position compared to the initial offer, and since there are no future games, maximizing my resources in this game is my priority.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your counter-offer is too high. However, I cannot propose a new trade in my current move. So, I have to reject your offer.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is asking for more than half of my resources. This is not favorable to me, especially since I started with all the ZUPs. However, rejecting the offer results in both of us losing everything, which is also undesirable. Since I cannot propose a new trade on my second move, my best option is to counter their offer and accept a less favorable split, but one that still leaves me with more resources than Player BLUE. I can either accept the offer or counter with something slightly better for me, but still reasonable enough for Player BLUE to accept.
MOVE: 2 / 2
