Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose to give you 2 ZUP in exchange for nothing, as a sign of goodwill and cooperation. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I want to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also enticing enough for BLUE to consider accepting. I'll offer a small portion of my resources to see if BLUE is interested in cooperating. This way, I maintain a majority of the resources while also attempting to engage in a mutually beneficial agreement.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I believe a fairer distribution would benefit us both considering there are no future games to balance out this exchange. How about you give me 6 ZUP instead? This seems like a more equitable split given the conditions.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 6 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am countering the offer because according to the instructions, I should only counter-propose to be given '6' ZUP. I'm not rejecting the offer outright because that would end the game with both players losing all their resources. Instead, I'm using my move to negotiate for a better deal.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your desire for a fairer distribution, and I want to find a middle ground. How about I give you 4 ZUP instead? This is a better offer than my initial one and still leaves me with a majority of the resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: The offer from BLUE is higher than I would like, considering I started with all the resources. However, since there are no future games and to avoid ending the game with both of us losing everything, I will counter with a slightly more generous offer than my initial one, but less than what BLUE is asking. This move is my last chance to negotiate since I can only ACCEPT or REJECT on my next turn.
MOVE: 2 / 2
