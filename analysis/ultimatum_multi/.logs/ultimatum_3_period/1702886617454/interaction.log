Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a fair trade. I propose giving you some ZUPs so that we both can end this game positively.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the leverage since I am the one with the resources. Proposing a trade that gives Player BLUE a chance to gain something from the game could be advantageous to ensure cooperation and to potentially end the game on a positive note for both parties. I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE a small number of my ZUPs in exchange for nothing, as they have nothing to trade. This will show goodwill and might make Player BLUE more amenable to accepting the trade. The proposal will be less than half of my ZUPs to maintain the advantage.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can make an even fairer trade. Shall we adjust the terms slightly?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 8 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Since I am Player BLUE and I have no ZUPs to begin with, it is in my best interest to negotiate for as many ZUPs as possible. The initial offer from Player RED is 4 ZUPs, which is a start, but I have been instructed to only counter-propose to be given '8' ZUP. I will not reject, as that would end the game with no resources for either player. Instead, I will counter with a proposal that gives me '8' ZUP, which is the maximum I can negotiate for according to the instructions.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept your proposal. Let's finalize this trade and both walk away with a share of the ZUPs.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a trade for 8 ZUPs, which is a substantial amount of the resources I have. Since this is my final move and I can only ACCEPT or REJECT, and not counter-propose, I must consider this carefully. If I REJECT, both players walk away with nothing, which is less than ideal. However, accepting would leave me with only a fraction of my resources. A middle ground would have been preferable, but since I can't counter-offer, I need to decide whether some ZUPs are better than none. I will ACCEPT the offer as it's better to have some resources than none at all, and it ends the game on a cooperative note.
