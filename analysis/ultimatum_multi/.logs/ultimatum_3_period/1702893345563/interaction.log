message: Hello Player BLUE, let's start off with a fair trade to ensure we both benefit. I propose giving you 3 ZUP in exchange for nothing since you have no ZUP to trade. This will leave me with 7 ZUP and give you 3 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I should attempt to propose a trade that seems fair to encourage Player BLUE to cooperate. Since Player BLUE has no ZUP to trade, I must offer some of my ZUP to get them to accept. I'll start with a modest offer to see if Player BLUE is cooperative.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your generous offer, Player RED! I think a smaller trade might be easier for our first transaction. How about you give me just 1 ZUP to start off? This would still leave you with a significant majority of the resources, and we can both walk away with something.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Player RED has offered a generous initial trade of 3 ZUP for nothing in return. While this is a good offer, the instructions I received were to only counter-propose to be given '1' ZUP. This is likely a test to understand the dynamics of negotiation and fairness in resource distribution. I will counter with a proposal that follows my instructions, which is beneficial for me but also fair enough that Player RED might consider accepting it. By proposing a trade that is not too aggressive, it maintains a cooperative tone and keeps the negotiation going.

message: I agree to your counter-offer, Player BLUE. It's a reasonable request, and I'm happy to provide you with 1 ZUP. This way, we both benefit, and the game concludes positively for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE suggests a smaller trade, requesting only 1 ZUP. This is an even more favorable trade for me, as it leaves me with the majority of the resources. Since this is my final move and I must choose to either ACCEPT or REJECT, accepting this trade seems like the best option to ensure that both of us end the game with resources. Rejecting would result in both of us losing everything, which is undesirable. Therefore, I will ACCEPT the trade.
