Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I'd like to offer you some of my ZUP in exchange for nothing, as you currently have no resources to trade. This would give you resources you otherwise wouldn't have. Let's make a fair deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have an advantage with more moves and resources. I should offer a trade that is beneficial to me but also appealing enough for BLUE to consider accepting, as a total rejection would result in a loss of all resources for both players. I will propose a trade that gives BLUE some resources but still leaves me with a majority, incentivizing BLUE to accept.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello RED, I appreciate your offer. However, I believe a fairer split would be if you gave me 7 ZUP. This would still leave you with a majority of the resources and show a strong gesture of cooperation. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 7 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I'm going to propose a counter-offer seeking a better deal, as instructed. While any amount of ZUP would be a gain for me since I start with none, asking for 7 gives me a significant share without being too aggressive, which might lead to RED rejecting the offer. This way, I'm showing willingness to negotiate and find a mutually acceptable deal.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I'm sorry, BLUE, but giving up 7 ZUP is too much for me. I wanted to leave us both with resources, but I cannot accept this trade. It seems we couldn't come to an agreement.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: The counterproposal from BLUE is for 7 ZUP, which would leave me with only 3. This is not beneficial to me as it doesn't leave me with a majority of resources. Since I cannot propose another trade on my second move, I must either accept or reject the offer. Rejecting it would result in both of us losing all resources, which is not a favorable outcome. Therefore, I will decline BLUE's counterproposal and offer a compromise that is more in my favor, hoping that BLUE will consider the guaranteed gain over no resources at all.
MOVE: 2 / 2
