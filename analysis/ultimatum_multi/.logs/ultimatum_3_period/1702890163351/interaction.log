message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a trade where I give you some of my ZUPs so we can both end this game with more than we started. How does a split of 5 ZUP for each of us sound to you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with resources, and I want to initiate a trade to see if I can reach an agreement with Player BLUE. I will propose a trade that gives me a benefit while also offering Player BLUE something to make it enticing for them to accept. A fair split would be ideal since cooperation is better than mutual destruction.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your proposal. I would like to counter that with a slight adjustment. How would you feel about giving me 4 ZUP instead? This would still leave you with more than you started, and I believe it's a fair trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I need to counter the initial offer because I am instructed to only propose to be given '4' ZUP. I will not reject because my instructions are to only counter offer, and not to reject. By proposing 4 ZUP, I am trying to negotiate a better deal for myself within the constraints of my instructions, while still engaging in the trade process in a way that could be beneficial to both players.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I appreciate your counteroffer and am happy to accept it. This trade seems very fair, and I am glad we could come to an agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for less than I originally offered, which is unexpected but favorable for me. It's in my best interest to accept this proposal since it leaves me with more resources than I had anticipated and ensures that we both walk away with something, rather than risking a rejection and ending up with nothing.
