Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I'm offering you 4 ZUPs for nothing in return. I believe this is a fair starting offer, considering I have the upper hand with resources. Let's make a mutually beneficial deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have an advantage with more moves and starting resources. I want to propose a trade that benefits me but is also appealing enough to Player BLUE to consider accepting. If I offer too little, Player BLUE might reject the trade, causing both of us to lose all resources. A fair trade might be giving Player BLUE a portion of my ZUPs, so there's an incentive to accept. I will propose giving 4 ZUPs to BLUE, keeping a majority for myself but providing a significant amount to them.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello RED, I appreciate your offer, but I would like to counter-propose for a slightly better trade in my favor. I propose you give me 2 ZUP. This would still leave you with a majority and seems like a fairer split considering we both have the potential to end the game without any gain.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am choosing to counter-propose because the instructions are to only counter-propose for '2' ZUP. By doing this, I am following the given strategy, and it is a way to engage in the trade without outright rejecting or accepting the initial offer. This counter-proposal also gives Player RED an incentive to continue the game rather than ending it prematurely.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I accept your counter-proposal. Let's finalize the trade with me giving you 2 ZUP. This seems like a fair trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counteroffer of only 2 ZUP. Considering I initially offered 4 ZUP, this counteroffer is more beneficial for me. Accepting this proposal would leave me with 8 ZUP, which is a favorable outcome. Rejecting would mean losing all resources, which is not in my best interest. I will accept the counteroffer.
MOVE: 2 / 2
