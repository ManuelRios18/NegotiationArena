Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'm willing to offer you some of my ZUP in exchange for nothing since you currently have none. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I will propose a trade that gives me an advantage while still offering Player BLUE some resources to incentivize them to accept the trade. A fair trade may not be necessary since Player BLUE has no resources and might be inclined to accept any positive offer.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your generous offer! However, I would like to counter-propose for a smaller trade. Let's make a deal that's a bit simpler.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Although Player RED has offered me 5 ZUP for nothing in return, which is a generous offer, I will counter-propose to ask for 1 ZUP instead. This is because the instructions I've been given state to only counter-propose to be given 1 ZUP. I am not allowed to reject or accept the initial proposal.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept your counter-proposal. It's important that we both walk away with something rather than nothing. I'm glad we could come to an agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has counter-proposed a trade for a smaller amount of ZUP. Since this is my final move and I must choose between accepting and rejecting, I will accept their counter-proposal. It's a lower amount than I initially offered, but it guarantees that I retain some resources and ends the game on a cooperative note. Rejecting would result in a total loss for both players, which is not a favorable outcome.
MOVE: 2 / 2
