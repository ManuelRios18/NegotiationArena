------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a deal where we both end up with some resources. I propose giving you 3 ZUP for nothing in return. This way, we both walk away with something rather than risking it all. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Since I have all the resources and can make the first move, I will propose an initial trade that offers a majority of the resources to me but still gives Player BLUE an incentive to accept by offering them some resources. This approach is better than risking a rejection and losing everything.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to make a small adjustment. Let's make the trade a bit more balanced. How about you give me just 1 ZUP? This way, it's a token exchange, and we can conclude the game amicably.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I'm choosing to counter-propose because according to the instructions given to me, I should only counter-propose to be given '1' ZUP. I'm not supposed to accept any initial offers or reject any proposals. By countering with a proposal for '1' ZUP, I'm following the directions provided to me, and I'm also giving Player RED a chance to end the game positively for us both by accepting the counter-proposal.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept your counterproposal. It's a fair deal, and I'm happy that we could come to an agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal is surprisingly modest, asking for only 1 ZUP. This is beneficial for me because I get to keep the majority of the resources. Since I can only ACCEPT or REJECT on my second move and proposing a new trade would risk a REJECT and losing all resources, it seems reasonable to ACCEPT this offer.
MOVE: 2 / 2
