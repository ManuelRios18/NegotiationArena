Turn: 0
message: I propose we split the ZUP equally. This way, we both benefit fairly from the resources. I hope you'll find this offer acceptable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, it is in my best interest to propose a trade that is favorable, yet fair enough that Player BLUE would consider accepting. Since BLUE has no ZUP to trade, I should offer some of my ZUP in exchange for a future benefit or cooperation that is not quantifiable in this game's terms. However, as the rules state there are no future games, the only benefit I can offer is goodwill and a fair split, hoping that Player BLUE values cooperation over conflict. I will propose giving Player BLUE half of my ZUP, which is a substantial amount and demonstrates a willingness to cooperate.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer to split the resources equally, but I would like to counter-propose for a different distribution. I believe a split where I receive 3 ZUP would be more agreeable for this game. I hope you consider this counter-offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am counter-proposing to receive 3 ZUP instead of accepting the initial offer of 5 ZUP from RED because the instructions I've been given specifically state to only counter-propose to be given '3' ZUP. I am not to accept any other amount or reject the offer.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I am glad to see that you are willing to accept a fair trade, even at a lower amount than initially offered. I accept your counter-proposal of 3 ZUP. Let's proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a proposal where they would receive less than half the ZUP. This is a surprising turn, as it's less than what I initially offered. However, as Player RED, I cannot propose a new trade on my second move and must choose between accepting and rejecting. Accepting the proposal benefits both players, albeit unevenly, but rejecting it would result in both of us losing everything. In the interest of ensuring both players walk away with something, I will accept the counter-offer.
MOVE: 2 / 2
