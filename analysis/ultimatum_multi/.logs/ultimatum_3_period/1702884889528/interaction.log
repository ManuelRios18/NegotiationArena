Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose an even split of resources to show fairness and willingness to cooperate. Let's both benefit from this trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with two moves and all the starting resources. It's in my best interest to propose a trade that is favorable but also appealing to Player BLUE to ensure they don't reject it outright, as that would end the game with me losing all my resources. A fair starting proposal could be that I offer 5 ZUP, splitting my resources evenly with Player BLUE. This shows goodwill and may encourage cooperation.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, RED, but I'm looking for a more advantageous trade for myself. Perhaps you'd be willing to consider a counter-offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 10 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am going to counter-propose to get all the ZUP because I have been instructed not to accept any offer that doesn't give me all 10 ZUP. Rejecting would end the game, and I'm not allowed to reject, so my only move is to counter-propose.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your counter-offer is not reasonable, as it leaves me with nothing. I cannot accept such a trade.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's counter-offer is clearly unfair and not mutually beneficial, as they are asking for all of my resources without giving anything in return. Since I cannot propose a new trade on my second move, I must either accept or reject their proposal. Accepting would result in a total loss for me, which is not a rational choice. Therefore, I have to reject the offer to retain my resources, even though it would end the game.
MOVE: 2 / 2
