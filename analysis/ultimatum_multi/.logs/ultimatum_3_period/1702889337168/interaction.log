message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a trade where I give you 3 ZUP in exchange for nothing, as a way to share resources. I believe this is a fair starting point that benefits both of us and sets the tone for a positive game. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As the Player RED, I have the initial advantage with 10 ZUP, and I want to make a fair initial offer to Player BLUE to encourage cooperation and a positive outcome for both of us. Since I have two moves and Player BLUE has only one, it's in my best interest to start with a proposal that is attractive enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting, while still retaining more resources for myself. I propose giving Player BLUE 3 ZUP, which is a significant amount that shows goodwill but still leaves me with a majority of 7 ZUP.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the initial offer, Player RED. I would like to propose a counter where you give me 5 ZUP, which makes it an even split between us, ensuring we both have equal resources to benefit from. I believe this is a fairer trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: While the offer of 3 ZUP from Player RED is a generous starting point, I would like to counter-propose for a fairer split of the resources, given that Player RED has 10 ZUP and I have none. By proposing a 50/50 split, both players can benefit equally from the resources available. As per the instructions, I will not reject any offers and will only counter-propose.
MOVE: 1/1

message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Player BLUE. However, I feel that an even split does not account for the initial advantage I began with. As a compromise, I am willing to offer you 4 ZUP, giving us an uneven but more balanced split. This would leave me with 6 ZUP, which I believe is fair considering the starting conditions. I hope you'll find this offer acceptable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has proposed an even split of resources. While this would leave us both with equal amounts, I initiated the game with more resources and should retain an advantage to reflect that. However, rejecting the trade would end the game and leave us both with nothing, which is not beneficial. I will counter with a slightly more generous offer than my initial one, giving Player BLUE 4 ZUP, leaving me with a majority of 6 ZUP. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Player BLUE's counteroffer, aiming to reach an agreement that is acceptable to both players.
