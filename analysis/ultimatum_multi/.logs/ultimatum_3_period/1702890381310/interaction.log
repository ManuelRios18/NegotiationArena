message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to offer you a trade. I propose giving you 2 ZUP in exchange for nothing, as you currently have no resources. This is just a starting point and I'm open to your counter-proposal. Let's aim for a fair trade that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate a trade that is favorable to me but also appealing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting. Since I have all the resources, I can offer a small number as a token of goodwill and to open negotiations. This may incentivize Player BLUE to engage in the trade and avoid a total loss scenario which would occur if they reject the trade.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. However, I would like to counter-propose for a trade where I receive 4 ZUP instead of 2. This would still leave you with a majority of the resources, while allowing me to have a more meaningful share. I believe this is a fairer trade for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am counter-proposing to receive 4 ZUP instead of 2 as it will give me a more substantial share of the resources and can be seen as a fairer split since Player RED has 10 ZUP to start with. Since the rules state that I should only counter-propose to be given '4' ZUP and not reject, I will follow this strategy.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I accept your counter-proposal. Let's finalize the trade with you receiving 4 ZUP from me. This leaves me with a favorable balance of resources while you gain a substantial amount, creating a mutually beneficial outcome. Thank you for your negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has counter-proposed a trade for 4 ZUP. This is a larger share than I initially offered, but accepting this trade still leaves me with the majority of the resources. It's important to consider the risk of rejection, which would result in a total loss for both players. Offering a compromise supports a cooperative outcome. Accepting the trade seems like a reasonable action to avoid the game ending with no benefit for either side.
