Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose that I give you 2 ZUP to get us started. This way, we both end up with some resources. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED with all the resources, I am in a position to propose an initial trade that is favorable to me but still offers Player BLUE an incentive to cooperate. Proposing a trade that provides BLUE some resources will help initiate negotiations and avoid an outright rejection. I will propose giving Player BLUE 2 ZUP in exchange for nothing, as they have nothing to offer. This leaves me with a significant majority of the resources but provides BLUE with an incentive to accept the trade.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer but would like to propose a slight change. How about you give me 2 ZUP to balance the resources a bit more in my favor since I am starting at a disadvantage with 0 ZUP?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am proposing a counter-offer to receive 2 ZUP because those are the instructions I've been given and it also gives me an opportunity to gain resources without currently having any to trade.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad we agree on the trade. This seems fair to both of us. Let's go ahead with the trade where I give you 2 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has suggested the same trade that I initially proposed, which is a favorable outcome for me. Since I am on my second and final move where I can only ACCEPT or REJECT and since Player BLUE has accepted the initial trade terms, I will ACCEPT this trade. This will guarantee that I retain the majority of the resources while still engaging in a cooperative agreement.
MOVE: 2 / 2
