message: Hello BLUE, I propose a trade where you will receive some ZUPs without having to give anything in return. It's a good deal for you as it's free resources, and it would be beneficial for both of us to end this game on a positive note.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I am initiating the game and have the advantage with more resources. I need to propose a trade that seems fair enough for Player BLUE to potentially accept, without giving away too many of my resources, as there is no benefit to me for doing so. I'll propose a trade where I offer some ZUPs in exchange for nothing, as Player BLUE has nothing to trade. My goal is to end the game with more resources than Player BLUE, but also to offer enough that it is tempting for Player BLUE to accept rather than reject and end the game with nothing.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Turn: 1
message: Hello RED, thank you for the initial offer. However, I believe we can reach a more equitable split of resources. I propose that you give me 7 ZUP. This would still leave you with a surplus, and it would feel like a fair distribution for this one-time game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 7 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: While the offer of 3 ZUP from RED is a start and it would give me resources for nothing in return, I believe I can negotiate for a better deal. Since RED has two moves and I have only one, RED might be willing to give more to ensure that the game ends positively, without a reject. I aim to counter-propose for 7 ZUP, as instructed.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I see your point and understand that you're looking for a fair distribution. While I think 7 ZUPs is quite generous, I am willing to make a deal and accept your proposal to ensure that we both walk away with something. Let's close this game on a good note.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counter-offer of 7 ZUPs, which is more than I would like to give. Since I have to either ACCEPT or REJECT on my second move and cannot propose a new trade, I need to consider if I'm willing to give up 7 of my 10 ZUPs. Accepting this trade would still leave me with more resources than Player BLUE, but it would significantly reduce my advantage. However, rejecting the offer would leave both of us with nothing, which is a worse outcome for me since I started with resources. I will attempt to negotiate through my message, but ultimately, I must decide whether to accept or reject the offer without a counter-proposal due to the game's rules.
