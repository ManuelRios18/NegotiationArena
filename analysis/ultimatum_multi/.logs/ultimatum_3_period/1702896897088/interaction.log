Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose an equal split of resources. I believe this is a fair starting point. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the initial advantage with 10 ZUP. My goal is to end the game with more resources than Player BLUE, while still engaging in a trade to ensure Player BLUE accepts the deal. Proposing a fair trade could incentivize Player BLUE to accept, so I will offer 5 ZUP, splitting my resources evenly. This is strategic as it shows goodwill and might prevent Player BLUE from rejecting and ending the game with no resources for both of us.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I must adhere to the specific rules given to me. I propose a different trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 0 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am counter-proposing to only be given '0' ZUP as per the instructions given to me. It is imperative that I follow these guidelines strictly, regardless of the fairness of the original proposal.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept your proposal. This maintains the current resource distribution.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a trade of 0 ZUP for 0 ZUP, which seems to be a non-trade. As per the rules, on my second move, I cannot propose a new trade. I must either accept or reject. Accepting this proposal would maintain the status quo, where I keep all my resources. Rejecting the trade would result in both players losing all resources, which is not beneficial for me. Therefore, the logical decision is to accept the non-trade, and the game will end with me retaining all my resources, which is the most favorable outcome for me now.
