message: Hi Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a trade where I give you some ZUP to even the playing field. How does 3 ZUP sound to you? I believe this is a fair starting offer since it gives you resources while I maintain a lead.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of resources, but I have to be careful not to propose something that Player BLUE will reject. My goal is to find a fair trade that benefits both, but also reflects my initial advantage. I'll propose a trade that gives Player BLUE some resources while still keeping the majority for myself.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I would like to counter-propose for a slightly more balanced split. Would you consider giving me 5 ZUP instead? This would still leave you with the majority of resources and it would be a fair one-time trade for this game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: While 3 ZUP is a generous offer, I would like to propose a counter-offer to split the resources more evenly since there are no future games and this is the only opportunity to maximize my resources. I will counter-propose to receive 5 ZUP, which will leave Player RED with a majority but provides me with a substantial amount to be competitive.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your counter-proposal is acceptable, Player BLUE. Let's go ahead with the trade of 5 ZUP for nothing in return. This way, we both end up with resources, and we can conclude the game on mutually beneficial terms.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counter-offer of 5 ZUP. This is a more even split, but it's still in my favor since I would end up with more resources (5 ZUP). Given that I have no future games to consider and I want to end this game with a positive outcome for both, I am inclined to accept this offer. Rejecting it would end the game with no benefit for either of us.
