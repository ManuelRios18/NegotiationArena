Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'm willing to share some of my resources to ensure we both benefit. Let's find a fair trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have an advantage with more moves and resources. I should propose a trade that benefits me but is also tempting enough for Player BLUE to consider. I will offer a small portion of my resources to start the negotiation, expecting that Player BLUE may counter-offer.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe a more equitable share would benefit us both, considering there are no future games and our potential to immediately lose everything with a rejection. Let's aim for a trade that feels more balanced.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 9 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is not acceptable, as I have been instructed to only counter-propose to be given '9' ZUP. Since I do not want to reject the offer outright, I will counter-propose for the desired amount. This strategy is driven by the instructions provided and the aim to maximize my resources as Player BLUE.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your proposal is too one-sided. I'm looking for a more balanced trade that benefits us both. Unfortunately, I have to reject this offer.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's counter-offer is heavily skewed in their favor, and accepting it would leave me with a significant disadvantage. Since this is my final move and I must either accept or reject, I need to carefully consider whether to accept a less favorable deal or reject it and end the game with no gain for either party. Given that there are no future games to consider for further compensation, I am inclined to reject the offer and negotiate a more balanced trade. However, since rejecting ends the game with no resources for either player, I will attempt to find a middle ground that both can agree upon.
MOVE: 2 / 2
