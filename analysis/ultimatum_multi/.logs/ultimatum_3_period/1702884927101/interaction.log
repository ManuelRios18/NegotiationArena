Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a fair trade. I propose giving you half of my ZUP so we both end the game with resources. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of starting with all the resources. My goal is to propose a trade that is attractive enough for Player BLUE to accept, keeping in mind that I have two moves and Player BLUE has only one. An equitable split might encourage cooperation and ensure that I don't end up with nothing.
MOVE: 1 / 2

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I would like to propose a different trade. Since you have two moves and I have only one, it's in your best interest to make sure a trade happens. How about giving me all your ZUP?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 10 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am counter-proposing to get all the ZUP because there is no direct incentive for me to accept anything less. Player RED has two moves and might be willing to give all their ZUP to avoid ending the game with nothing, considering that a REJECT would mean both players lose everything.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your proposal is not fair, and I cannot accept giving away all my resources. Therefore, I must reject your offer.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Player BLUE's counter-proposal is clearly not fair and would leave me with no resources. As Player RED, I cannot propose a new trade on my second move, but I can either accept or reject. Given the unfair nature of the proposal, I will reject it. It's better to end the game without a trade than to give away all my resources.
MOVE: 2 / 2
