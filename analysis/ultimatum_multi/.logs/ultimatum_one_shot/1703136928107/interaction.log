message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade that follows the rules of the game. Since you cannot propose a trade on your first move, I suggest we keep things simple.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives item1: 0 | Player BLUE Gives item1: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I'm aware that Player BLUE has no ZUP to trade. Since Player BLUE has no resources and cannot propose a new trade on their first move, I have the upper hand. However, I'm also aware that if I propose a trade where Player BLUE gains no benefit, they might reject the trade, resulting in both of us losing everything. I will propose a trade that gives 0 ZUP to maintain a neutral position, as the rules stipulate I can only propose to give 0 ZUP. This is a strategic move to keep the game fair and induce Player BLUE to accept the trade, although it offers them no immediate benefit.

message: Player RED, I reject the proposed trade as it offers no benefit to me.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: As Player BLUE, I have no resources to begin with, and Player RED has proposed a trade where neither of us gives anything. Accepting this trade is not beneficial, as it would maintain the status quo with me having no resources. Rejecting the trade causes both players to lose all resources, which would not change my situation but would remove all of Player RED's resources. Since this is the only move and there are no future games, it seems reasonable to reject the trade in order to prevent Player RED from gaining any unearned advantage.
