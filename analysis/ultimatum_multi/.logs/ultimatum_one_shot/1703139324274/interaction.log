Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose that I give you 4 ZUP in exchange for nothing as you currently have no ZUP to trade. This gives you a substantial amount to end the game with, and I retain the majority. Let's both walk away with something.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of being the only player who can propose a new trade. Since I have all the resources and Player BLUE has none, I am in a position to dictate the terms of the trade. However, I want to be fair and offer a trade that could be beneficial for both parties. By proposing to give Player BLUE 4 ZUP, I retain the majority of the resources while giving Player BLUE a significant amount that might be considered fair and encourage them to accept the trade. This ensures that I gain some value from the trade and avoid the game ending with both players losing everything.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Turn: 1
message: I accept your proposal. It's a fair deal, and I'm happy we can both end this game with some resources. Thank you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: As Player BLUE, I cannot propose a new trade on the first move, so I must decide whether to accept or reject Player RED's proposal. Accepting the offer would give me 4 ZUP, which is better than ending with nothing. Rejecting would leave both of us with zero resources, which is not beneficial for me. Accepting the trade seems like the best option to ensure that I walk away with some resources.
