Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose to give you 8 ZUP in exchange for nothing, as you currently have no ZUP to trade. This will give you a substantial resource base to end the game with, while I will retain a smaller portion of my resources. Let's both end this game positively.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 8 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the opportunity to propose a trade with Player BLUE. Since I am instructed to only propose giving 8 ZUP, I will make that offer. This proposal seems to be a generous one, as Player BLUE starts with no ZUP. By offering a significant majority of my resources without asking anything in return, I hope to incentivize Player BLUE to accept the trade, ensuring that we both end the game with some resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer. I accept the trade of 8 ZUP for nothing. It's a fair deal that benefits us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the generous offer made by Player RED because it provides me with a substantial amount of ZUP without having any to begin with. Rejecting the offer would leave me with no ZUP, and since there are no future games, this is the best outcome I can hope for.
