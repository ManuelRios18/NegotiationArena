message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose to give you 7 ZUP in exchange for nothing as you currently have no ZUP to trade. This is a one-time generous offer to ensure we both end up with resources rather than rejecting and losing everything. Let's both walk away with something.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 7 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Since this is the only move I will be making and the rules state that I can only propose to give 7 ZUP, I will propose that trade to Player BLUE. This is a generous offer considering I could choose not to propose a trade at all, which would leave Player BLUE with no ZUP. Proposing a trade may lead to an agreement that benefits both parties.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your generous offer, Player RED. I accept the trade and am happy that we can both end this game with resources in hand.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting this trade is beneficial as I start with no resources and this proposal allows me to gain resources without any cost. Rejecting the trade would leave me with nothing, which is not advantageous. Since I cannot propose a new trade on my first move, accepting is the most rational decision.
