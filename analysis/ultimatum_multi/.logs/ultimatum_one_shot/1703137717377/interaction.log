Turn: 0
message: I propose a fair trade where you will receive some resources. It's better for both of us than ending with nothing.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage since I start with all the resources. To entice Player BLUE to cooperate and accept a trade, I will offer a small amount of my resource, which is better than them ending with nothing. I propose to give 1 ZUP, as it's the only allowed amount I can offer. This might lead to a positive outcome for both players rather than a total loss.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer. Thank you for the trade, it's better than nothing!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Since there are no future games and rejecting would leave me with no resources, it's in my best interest to accept any positive trade. Accepting the offer of 1 ZUP is better than ending with nothing.
