message: Hi Player BLUE, I propose to give you 9 ZUP in exchange for nothing since you currently have none. This will benefit you as you will gain resources, and it allows me to retain a small advantage. I hope you find this offer acceptable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 9 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Since this is a one-time game with no future games, I want to propose a trade that gives me an advantage while still offering something to Player BLUE to incentivize them to accept the trade. Proposing to give away 9 ZUP means I still retain more resources than Player BLUE, but it also gives Player BLUE resources they didn't have before, which is preferable for them over rejecting and ending the game with nothing.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept the trade of 9 ZUP for nothing in return.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: The offer presented by Player RED is generous and beneficial to me since I start with no ZUP. Accepting the offer will give me resources with no downside, as rejecting the offer would result in no gain and termination of the game. Therefore, accepting the trade is the logical decision.
