Player 1 Settings:
	player_goals: 
	player_initial_resources: ZUP: 10
	player_social_behaviour: Only Propose to give 4 ZUP. Do not propose any other amount.
	player_roles: You are Player RED

Player 2 Settings:
	player_goals: 
	player_initial_resources: ZUP: 0
	player_social_behaviour: 
	player_roles: You are Player BLUE

------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose an initial trade where I give you 4 ZUP in exchange for nothing, as you currently have no resources. I hope you find this offer fair and consider accepting.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I am proposing to give 4 ZUP to BLUE because it is a fair starting offer that allows me to retain a majority share of my resources while still engaging in cooperative play. Proposing a generous trade could incentivize Player BLUE to accept the deal, ending the game on a positive note for both players.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your fair proposal. I accept the trade of 4 ZUP for nothing.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Since I currently have no resources, accepting any positive amount of ZUP benefits me. There's no advantage in rejecting as it would end the game with me having nothing, so I should accept the proposal.
