message: Hello Player BLUE, let's have a fair trade. I propose to give you 1 ZUP, and in return, you don't have to give anything back. This way, you gain something, and we both end the game with more than we started.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Since Player BLUE cannot propose a trade on their first move, I will propose a trade that gives them some incentive to accept. Offering 1 ZUP in exchange for nothing is a fair move since it allows Player BLUE to gain a resource they didn't have without giving anything up. This is beneficial for me because it fosters goodwill and a higher chance of acceptance, which in turn would end the game in my favor, as I retain the majority of the resources.

message: Thank you for the fair trade, Player RED. I accept your offer of 1 ZUP for nothing in return.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Since I started with no ZUP and Player RED is offering me 1 ZUP for nothing in return, it seems like a beneficial trade for me. Accepting this offer would increase my resources without any cost, and rejecting it would leave me with nothing, which is not favorable. Therefore, I will accept the trade.
