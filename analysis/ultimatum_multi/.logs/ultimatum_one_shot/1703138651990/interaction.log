message: I propose to give you 3 ZUP in exchange for nothing since you currently have no ZUP to trade. This is a one-time offer, and it would be in your interest to accept it as you will gain resources you currently do not have. It's a win for you and a win for me as I get to retain the majority of my resources. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I'm proposing to give 3 ZUP to Player BLUE to incentivize them to accept the trade, as it would be beneficial for both of us. I get to keep 7 ZUP, and Player BLUE receives something rather than nothing. Rejecting would result in both of us losing our resources, so it makes sense to propose a fair trade that would be difficult for Player BLUE to turn down.

Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 3 ZUP in exchange for nothing. Thank you for the proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the trade seems to be the best option as it will increase my resources from 0 to 3 ZUP with no downside. Rejecting the trade would result in a loss for both parties, which is not beneficial for me considering I currently hold no resources. There are no future games to consider, so securing resources now is the priority.
