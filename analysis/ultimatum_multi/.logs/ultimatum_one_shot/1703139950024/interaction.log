message: I am proposing a fair trade of 6 ZUP in the spirit of cooperation, so we both can end this game with resources. I hope you find this offer acceptable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 6 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the opportunity to propose a trade to Player BLUE. Given the instructions, I must propose giving exactly 6 ZUP, which seems to be a generous offer considering Player BLUE starts with no resources to trade. This could incentivize Player BLUE to accept the trade, allowing us both to end the game with resources. There is also no advantage in hoarding resources since there are no future games.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair proposal. I accept your offer of 6 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: The proposal made by Player RED seems fair and cooperative, offering me 6 ZUP for nothing in return. Accepting this trade is beneficial as it allows me to gain resources without any cost, and rejecting would end the game with no benefit for either party. It is in my best interest to accept this trade.
