Turn: 0
message: I propose to give you 9 ZUP in exchange for nothing, as you currently have no resources. This trade would benefit you greatly, and I would still keep 1 ZUP. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 9 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the opportunity to propose a trade. Since the rules stipulate I should only propose to give 9 ZUP, I will do so. This may create an incentive for Player BLUE to accept, as they would receive a significant amount of resources while I retain some resources as well. Proposing a fair trade can lead to a mutually beneficial outcome, avoiding the scenario where both players end up with nothing.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED! I accept the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the trade gives me 9 ZUP, which is a significant amount considering I started with none. Rejecting the trade provides no benefit and ends the game with me having no resources. No counter-proposal is allowed for Player BLUE on the first move. Accepting is the most beneficial action.
