message: I'm offering 2 ZUP to you in the spirit of cooperation. I hope you'll find this trade acceptable as it would benefit you with no cost. Looking forward to a positive response!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the opportunity to propose a trade. Since Player BLUE has no ZUP to trade and I am instructed to only propose giving 2 ZUP, I will propose a trade where I give 2 ZUP to BLUE in the hopes of cooperation and fairness. This proposal is also made with the understanding that BLUE cannot counter-propose and must either accept or reject, so it is in my best interest to make an offer that is likely to be accepted.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer! I accept the trade of 2 ZUP for nothing in return. It's a pleasure doing business with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the trade is the most beneficial action as it provides me with 2 ZUP at no cost, thus increasing my resources. Rejecting would result in a loss of potential resources for no gain. Since I cannot propose a new trade on my move as per the rules, I will accept the offer.
