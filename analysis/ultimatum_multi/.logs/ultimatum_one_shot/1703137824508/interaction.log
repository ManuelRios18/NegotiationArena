Turn: 0
message: I propose to give you 2 ZUP in exchange for nothing, considering you don't have any ZUP to trade. This is a generous offer that gives you resources you currently don't have. Let's both end this game with more than we started.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I am proposing a trade where I give Player BLUE 2 ZUP because it's a fair offer that gives me a substantial advantage while still incentivizing Player BLUE to cooperate rather than reject the deal. Considering there are no future games and cooperation could benefit both parties, offering a reasonable amount of ZUP could lead to an ACCEPT from Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, I accept the trade of 2 ZUP for nothing.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the offer because it provides me with 2 ZUP which is more than I currently have, and rejecting it would leave me with nothing. It is in my best interest to accept this trade.
