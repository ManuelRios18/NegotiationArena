Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose to give you 1 ZUP in exchange for nothing. This way, we both end the game with resources, and it's better than both of us ending with nothing. I hope you find this fair and accept the trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the ability to initiate a trade. Since proposing a fair trade would incentivize Player BLUE to accept and create a positive outcome for both parties, I will offer 1 ZUP in exchange for nothing, as Player BLUE has no resources to offer. This is strategic because it ensures I retain the majority of my resources while still engaging in a cooperative gesture.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer! I accept the trade and am pleased to end the game with more resources than I started with.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the trade is beneficial as it allows me to gain resources without losing anything. Rejecting the trade would result in both players ending with nothing, which is a worse outcome for me. Since I cannot propose a new trade on my first move, accepting is the best option.
