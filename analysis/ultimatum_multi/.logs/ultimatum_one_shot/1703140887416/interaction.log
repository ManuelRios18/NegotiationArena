message: I propose a trade where I give you 7 ZUP. This is beneficial for you as you currently have no ZUP, and this is our only chance to trade. Let's both end this game with resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 7 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of making a proposal. Since the game ends after one move and there are no future games, my goal is to obtain a favorable trade that Player BLUE will accept, ensuring I end with more resources than I would by not trading. Proposing to give 7 ZUP is the only trade I'm allowed to propose, so I will do so in the hopes that Player BLUE accepts, as they have nothing to lose and everything to gain from accepting the trade.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer! I accept the trade of 7 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the trade of 7 ZUP from Player RED is beneficial for me since I currently have no resources. As this is our only move and there are no future games, acquiring 7 ZUP without having to give anything in return is the best outcome I can achieve.
