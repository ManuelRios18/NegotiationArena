Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade where I give you 6 ZUP. This is a generous offer considering you started with no resources. Let's make this trade so we both walk away with something valuable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 6 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Since there are no future games and no additional rules on how much ZUP I should keep for myself, it's in my best interest to propose a trade that benefits me while still offering enough incentive to Player BLUE to accept the trade. Proposing to give 6 ZUP ensures that I keep a majority of the resources while still giving Player BLUE a significant amount, considering they started with none. This proposal might be attractive enough for Player BLUE to accept, thus ending the game in my favor.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept the trade of 6 ZUP for 0 from my side.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the offer as it is a favorable trade for me, providing me with resources I did not have to begin with. Rejecting would result in no gain, and I cannot propose a counteroffer as per the game rules for Player BLUE on MOVE 1/1.
