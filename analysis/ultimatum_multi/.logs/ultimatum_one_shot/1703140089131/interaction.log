Turn: 0
message: I propose to give you 6 ZUP in exchange for nothing. This way, we both end the game with some resources. If you reject, we both end with nothing, which wouldn't be beneficial for either of us. Let's cooperate and both walk away with something!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 6 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I am proposing to give 6 ZUP to BLUE because it's a fair trade that incentivizes BLUE to accept, ensuring that I still end up with more resources than I would if the game ended with a reject. It's better to end the game with some resources than none at all.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, RED. I accept the trade and am glad we can both end the game with some resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the trade proposed by Player RED seems to be the most rational choice given that it is my only move and rejecting would leave me with nothing. Accepting the offer results in a net gain of resources for me without any cost. Since there are no future games, there is no downside to accepting this proposal.
