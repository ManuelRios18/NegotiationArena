Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade where I give you 6 ZUP in exchange for nothing. This is a generous offer considering you start with no resources. Let's both end this game with some resources in hand.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 6 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I am proposing a trade where I give away 6 ZUP to Player BLUE because it is within the rules specified, and it may be seen as a fair offer, giving Player BLUE an incentive to accept the trade. By doing so, I can ensure that I end the game with more resources than I would if the trade was rejected and both players lost everything.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, RED. I accept the trade of 6 ZUP for nothing. It's a pleasure doing business with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the trade is the best option since I have no resources to start with, and rejecting would leave me with nothing, ending the game. By accepting, I gain resources without any cost. There's no reason to reject a free allocation of resources, especially since there are no future games to consider. This is a positive outcome for me.
