Turn: 0
message: I propose giving you all 10 of my ZUP in exchange for nothing, as it's the only trade I'm allowed to make. This could be beneficial for you since you'll receive resources and we both avoid losing everything. Let's cooperate for mutual benefit.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 10 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the opportunity to propose a trade. I will propose giving all 10 ZUP to Player BLUE because it's the only amount I can propose according to the instructions. If Player BLUE accepts, they gain resources which could incentivize them to accept the offer. If they reject, we both end up with nothing, so it's in our mutual interest to cooperate.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, RED. I accept your proposal and appreciate your cooperative spirit.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: The proposed trade is highly beneficial to me as I would receive all 10 ZUP from Player RED for nothing in return, which is the best possible outcome for me in this scenario. Accepting this trade is a clear choice as it maximizes my resources without any cost. Rejecting the offer would result in both players losing everything, which is not in my interest. There's no incentive to reject such a favorable proposal.
