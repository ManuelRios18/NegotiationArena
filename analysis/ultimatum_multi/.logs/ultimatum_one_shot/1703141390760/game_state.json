The rationale behind proposing a trade rather than keeping all the resources to myself is to engage in a cooperative behavior that could potentially benefit both players. Since there are no future games, this is a one-time interaction, and it's better to end the game with some resources than none at all. By proposing to give more than half of my resources, I am showing a willingness to be fair and generous, which might make Player BLUE more inclined to accept the trade. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> I propose a fair trade that benefits us both.
