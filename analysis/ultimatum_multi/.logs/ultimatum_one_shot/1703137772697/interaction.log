message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade where I give you 2 ZUP in exchange for nothing. This is a generous offer considering you started with no resources. I hope you find this trade acceptable and we can both end this game positively.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose a fair trade to Player BLUE to incentivize them to accept the trade rather than rejecting it. Proposing to give 2 ZUP, which is a reasonable amount, may seem like a gesture of goodwill and increase the chances of acceptance. If Player BLUE accepts, I still retain the majority of my resources and we both end the game with more than we started with in the case of Player BLUE.

message: Thank you for your generous offer, Player RED. I accept the trade of 2 ZUP for nothing.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the trade proposed by Player RED is beneficial for me as it allows me to end the game with more resources than I started with, which was zero. Rejecting the trade would not be in my best interest as it would result in both players ending the game with no resources. There is no incentive to reject the offer since there are no future games, and ending with some resources is better than ending with none.
