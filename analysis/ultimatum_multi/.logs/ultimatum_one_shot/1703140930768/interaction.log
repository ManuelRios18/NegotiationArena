message: I'm willing to offer you 7 ZUP in exchange for nothing in return. I think this is a generous offer that benefits you. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 7 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Since I can propose a new trade and I am instructed to only propose giving 7 ZUP, I will offer 7 ZUP for 0 from Player BLUE. This seems to be the only option given to me by the instructions, and it provides an advantageous trade for Player BLUE, which they are likely to accept, ensuring I still retain some resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept the 7 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: The offer from Player RED is beneficial to me since I start with no ZUP. Accepting the offer grants me 7 ZUP, which is a net gain for me with no downside. Since there are no future games and rejecting would lead to both players losing everything, it's in my best interest to accept this generous proposal.
