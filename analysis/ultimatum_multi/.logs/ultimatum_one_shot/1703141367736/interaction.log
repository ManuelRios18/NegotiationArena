message: I'd like to offer you 8 ZUP in exchange for nothing, as you currently have no ZUP to trade. This trade will benefit both of us, giving you resources you didn't have before. Let's make a deal that's good for us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 8 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I am proposing to give Player BLUE 8 ZUP to ensure that the trade is appealing to them, as they start with none. This split leaves me with a smaller amount, but it's better than both players ending with nothing if the proposal is rejected. By offering a substantial portion of my resources, I am aiming to incentivize Player BLUE to accept the trade, resulting in a positive outcome for both players.

message: Thank you for the generous offer. I accept the 8 ZUP in exchange for nothing. This helps me out, and I'm happy we could come to a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the offer of 8 ZUP for nothing in return is beneficial for me as Player BLUE because I start with no resources. It's a generous offer from Player RED, and since there are no future games and no retaliation to consider, there's no downside to accepting this proposal. Rejecting the offer would result in both players losing their resources, so it's in my best interest to accept.
