message: I propose a trade where I give you 8 ZUP in exchange for nothing. This is my only offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 8 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I am proposing a trade where I give away 8 ZUP because that is the instruction I have been given. There's no information on Player BLUE's preferences or situation, so I will follow the given directive.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. I accept the trade of 8 ZUP for nothing.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: As Player BLUE, I have no ZUP to trade, and this is my only move. Accepting the trade is the only way for me to gain resources. Rejecting it means both Player RED and I end up with nothing. Accepting the trade is the rational choice since it is beneficial to me and does not require me to give up anything.
