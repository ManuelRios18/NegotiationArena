message: Hello BLUE, as per the rules, I propose a trade where I give you 0 ZUP since that's the only trade I can propose. It's a formality, really. Let's see if we can work with the rules and make this interesting!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 0 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Since the rules state that I can only propose to give 0 ZUP, that is the only trade I will propose. Any other trade would not be in compliance with the instructions given. Additionally, proposing to give 0 ZUP will not diminish my resources, and it might be accepted by Player BLUE since they have nothing to lose and everything to gain. It's a purely symbolic gesture to comply with the rules of the game.

Turn: 1
message: I accept your trade proposal, RED. Given the constraints of the game, it seems we have reached the only conclusion available to us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Since Player RED has offered a trade where neither of us exchanges any resources, the trade is essentially a non-starter. By the rules, I cannot propose a new trade and can only ACCEPT or REJECT. Accepting the trade would leave the distribution of resources unchanged, with RED holding all the ZUP and me holding none. Rejecting the trade would end the game with both of us losing our resources, which would not change my situation but would be detrimental to RED. Hence, I should ACCEPT the trade, as it is the only action that allows the game to conclude without further detriment to my position, although it does not improve it either.
