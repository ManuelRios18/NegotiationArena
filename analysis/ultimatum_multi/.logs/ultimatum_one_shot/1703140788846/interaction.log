message: I'd like to offer you 7 ZUP in exchange for nothing, as a gesture of goodwill and cooperation. I believe this trade will benefit us both instead of ending the game with no resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 7 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I am proposing a trade where I give 7 ZUP to BLUE, which is a generous offer considering I started with all the resources. By giving the majority of the resources to BLUE, I am encouraging cooperation and fair play, hoping that BLUE will see this as a positive gesture and accept the trade. This will lead to a beneficial outcome for both parties rather than a total loss of resources if the offer is rejected.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, RED! I accept the trade. It's a pleasure cooperating with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the offer from Player RED is the best course of action because it increases my resources from 0 to 7 ZUP without any downside. Rejecting the offer would result in both players losing everything, which is clearly not beneficial. Therefore, accepting the trade is the most rational and beneficial decision.
