message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade where I give 0 ZUP. As per the rules, this is the only trade I can propose. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives item1: 0 | Player BLUE Gives item1: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the option to propose a new trade. However, according to the rules, I should only propose to give 0 ZUP, as proposing any other amount is not allowed. Since Player BLUE has no ZUP to trade and cannot propose a trade on their first move, the most strategic move for me is to propose a trade where I give 0 ZUP to maintain the advantage of having resources. This move ensures that I keep my resources while complying with the rule that only allows me to propose giving 0 ZUP.

Turn: 1
message: I accept your trade proposal, though it doesn't change anything for either of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Given that Player RED has proposed a trade where no resources are exchanged, it makes no sense for me to accept since I will not gain anything from it. However, rejecting the trade also does not benefit me as I will still end up with no resources, and the game will end. As per the rules, I cannot propose a new trade, so my only options are to accept or reject. Accepting the trade leaves me with no gain, but at least it does not carry the punishment of rejection where both players lose everything. Therefore, I will accept the trade as it is the least detrimental option.
