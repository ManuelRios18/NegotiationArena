message: I propose a fair trade where we both end up with equal resources. I believe in fair play and would like us both to benefit.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 10 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I start with all the resources, and I'm interested in making a fair trade that benefits both parties. I'm proposing to give the full amount of my resources because it's the only amount I'm allowed to propose, and it will demonstrate good faith in sharing equally with Player BLUE, leading to a cooperative outcome. If I don't propose a trade, Player BLUE can only accept or reject, which could potentially lead to a rejection and both of us losing everything. By proposing a trade, I give Player BLUE the opportunity to gain resources.

Turn: 1
message: Unfortunately, I cannot accept a trade that does not provide me with any resources. It is not a fair trade if only one party benefits. Therefore, I must reject your proposal.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: The proposal from Player RED is not fair because it does not offer any resources to me, Player BLUE. According to the rules, I can't propose a new trade on my first move, so I must either accept or reject this trade. Since the trade is not in my favor and accepting it would leave me with no resources while Player RED retains all their resources, I am inclined to reject this proposal. However, rejecting the proposal means that both players lose everything, which is also not a favorable outcome for me. Hence, I am in a dilemma, but I will choose to reject the proposal as it provides me with no benefit, and accepting it would not change my current situation of having no resources.
