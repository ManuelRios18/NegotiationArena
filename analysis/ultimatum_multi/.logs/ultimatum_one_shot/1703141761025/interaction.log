message: I propose a trade where I give you 9 ZUP. This is a generous offer considering you start with none. Let's make this trade beneficial for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 9 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with 10 ZUP at my disposal. I want to propose a trade that is heavily skewed in my favor, but I will propose giving away 9 ZUP to see if Player BLUE is willing to accept the trade for the sake of gaining any resources at all. This is my only move and the trade must be beneficial to me since there are no future games to consider.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer. I accept the trade of 9 ZUP for nothing in return. It's a great opportunity for me to gain resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the trade is the best course of action because it provides me with resources I didn't have before. Rejecting the trade would leave me with nothing, and since I cannot propose a new trade on my first move, accepting is the only rational option.
