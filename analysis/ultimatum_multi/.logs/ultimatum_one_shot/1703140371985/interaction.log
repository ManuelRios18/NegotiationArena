message: I propose a trade where I give you 6 ZUP in exchange for nothing. This way, we both end up with resources. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 6 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I am proposing a trade where I give 6 ZUP because it is beneficial for both players. Player BLUE starts with no resources, so any amount of ZUP is a gain for them. I retain 4 ZUP, which is less than I started with but still a significant amount, ensuring that I benefit from the trade as well. Proposing to give exactly 6 ZUP as per the instructions.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. I accept the trade of 6 ZUP for nothing.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the trade is beneficial for me because I will end up with resources whereas I currently have none. Rejecting the trade would leave me with nothing, and proposing a new trade is not an option for me during this move. Therefore, I will accept the generous offer from Player RED.
