Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, as there are no future games and this is our last move, I propose a trade where I give 0 ZUP since it doesn't change the resource balance and we can end this game peacefully.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives item1: 0 | Player BLUE Gives item1: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Since the game ends after this move and there are no future games, it's beneficial for me to hold onto my resources. Proposing a trade where I give 0 ZUP ensures I keep my resources while still following the rules of making a proposal.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the proposal, Player RED. I accept the trade as it stands. Let's end this game on a peaceful note.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Since Player RED has proposed a trade where no resources are exchanged, accepting this proposal results in no gain for me, but also no loss. Rejecting it would mean both players lose everything, which is a worse outcome. Therefore, even though I don't gain anything from this trade, it's still the best move to accept it and end the game without losing resources.
