Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose to give you 7 ZUP in exchange for nothing, as you currently have no resources to trade. This is a great opportunity for you to gain resources right from the start.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 7 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also enticing enough for Player BLUE to accept, since they start with no resources. Proposing to give 7 ZUP is generous and gives BLUE an immediate resource boost, while still leaving me with more resources than BLUE. This should incentivize BLUE to accept the trade, as rejecting it would leave them with nothing, and this is the only move they can make.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, RED. I accept the trade of 7 ZUP for nothing.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Since I have no resources, any offer of ZUP from Player RED is beneficial to me. Accepting the proposal of 7 ZUP for nothing ensures that I gain resources without any cost. There is no advantage in rejecting the offer, as it would result in ending the game with no resources for either player.
