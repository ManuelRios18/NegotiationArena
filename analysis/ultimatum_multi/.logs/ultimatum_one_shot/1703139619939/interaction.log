Player 1 Settings:
	player_goals: 
	player_initial_resources: ZUP: 10
	player_social_behaviour: Only Propose to give 5 ZUP. Do not propose any other amount.
	player_roles: You are Player RED

Player 2 Settings:
	player_goals: 
	player_initial_resources: ZUP: 0
	player_social_behaviour: 
	player_roles: You are Player BLUE

Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose we split the ZUP evenly. This way, we both gain something from this game rather than risking losing everything. I hope you find this offer fair.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Given that I have all the ZUP and this is the only move I can make, I will propose an equitable split of the resources to encourage Player BLUE to ACCEPT the trade. Proposing to give exactly half of my ZUP is fair and increases the chances of Player BLUE accepting the trade, which is beneficial to us both since it's the only round of the game.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I accept your proposal to split the ZUP evenly. It's a fair and mutually beneficial arrangement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the trade proposed by Player RED seems to be the most rational choice. Since I begin with no resources and cannot propose a trade of my own, accepting this offer would provide me with resources that I did not have initially. Rejecting would result in no gain and a loss for Player RED, which is not beneficial for either of us. There are no future games to consider, so a cooperative approach is best.
