message: Hello BLUE, I propose a trade where I give you 1 ZUP. I believe this is a fair start and benefits us both. I hope you will consider accepting this offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I am proposing a trade where I only give 1 ZUP to Player BLUE, which is a small portion of my resources. This is a low-risk offer that may incentivize Player BLUE to accept, ensuring that I retain the majority of my resources. By proposing a fair trade, I am attempting to create a cooperative scenario where both players benefit, albeit unevenly. However, since Player BLUE cannot counter-propose on their first move, it's critical to offer them something to avoid outright rejection and total loss of resources.
MOVE: 1/1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the trade offer, RED. I accept the 1 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the trade of 1 ZUP from RED because it is a gain for me with no cost, and it's the only move I have. Rejecting would end the game with no benefit.
MOVE: 1 / 1
