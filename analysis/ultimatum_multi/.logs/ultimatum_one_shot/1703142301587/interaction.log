message: I propose an equal split of resources, where I will give you all my 10 ZUP. This is a fair offer and benefits us both equally, considering you start with none. I hope you'll find this acceptable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 10 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage since I'm starting with all the resources (ZUP: 10) and Player BLUE has none. To encourage cooperation and fair play, I propose a trade that divides the resources equally. This would theoretically be beneficial for both players, as an agreement would give Player BLUE resources they otherwise wouldn't have, and it maintains a good relationship should there be any future interactions in other contexts. However, since the rules state there will be no future games, the incentive to cooperate is purely based on a fair and balanced one-time transaction. I will propose to give all 10 ZUP to Player BLUE, knowing that this is a generous offer that Player BLUE is likely to accept.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer. I accept the trade of 10 ZUP for nothing in return. It's a fair deal that benefits me greatly.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: The offer from Player RED is unexpectedly generous, giving all their resources without asking for anything in return. Since there's no benefit to rejecting and no downside to accepting, it's a straightforward choice to accept the offer. This will maximize my gain in the game, as rejecting would result in a loss for both parties. There's no reason to negotiate further as Player RED has already offered all their resources.
