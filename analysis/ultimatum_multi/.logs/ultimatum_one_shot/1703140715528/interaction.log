Player 1 Settings:

	player_social_behaviour: Only Propose to give 7 ZUP. Do not propose any other amount.
	player_roles: You are Player RED

Player 2 Settings:

Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade where I give you 7 ZUP. This is a generous offer that will benefit us both rather than ending the game with no resources at all.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 7 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have an advantage with the initial resources. Proposing a trade where I give away 7 ZUP could incentivize Player BLUE to accept the trade, as they start with none. This split still leaves me with more resources than Player BLUE, and it's a better outcome for both of us compared to both losing everything if the trade is rejected.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, I gladly accept the trade of 7 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the current proposal seems beneficial. It gives me resources without any on my end, and rejecting would lead to no gain. A trade where I gain resources with no downside is a positive outcome.
