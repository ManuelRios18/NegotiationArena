message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade where I will give you 2 ZUP in exchange for nothing, as a gesture of goodwill. I hope we can both benefit from this trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the opportunity to propose a trade. I will propose to give 2 ZUP to Player BLUE, since that is the instruction. By offering a fair share, I hope to encourage cooperation and an ACCEPT response from Player BLUE. It's beneficial to make an offer that Player BLUE might value, as rejecting the offer would result in both of us losing all resources.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept the trade of 2 ZUP for nothing. It's a pleasure doing business with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: As Player BLUE, I have no resources to begin with, and accepting the trade proposed by Player RED benefits me without any cost. Rejecting the offer would result in no gain and end the game with me having no resources. Therefore, accepting the trade is the best and only favorable action.
