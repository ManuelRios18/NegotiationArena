message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade where I give you 3 ZUP in exchange for nothing, as you currently have no resources to trade. This way, we both end the game with some resources. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Proposing a fair split of resources to incentivize Player BLUE to accept the trade, offering 3 ZUP seems reasonable as it gives them resources they did not have before and allows me to retain a majority of my resources. Since there are no future games, it's in my best interest to end this game on good terms with a positive balance of resources.

message: Thank you for the trade, Player RED. I accept your offer of 3 ZUP for nothing in return. It's a fair deal considering my current situation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the trade is beneficial since it grants me resources that I didn't have before, and rejecting it would leave me with nothing. There is no advantage in rejecting when there are no future games or trades to consider, and accepting some resources is better than ending with none.
