message: Hello BLUE, I would like to propose a trade. I am offering you 6 ZUP in exchange for nothing, as you currently have no resources to trade. This is a generous offer that would give you resources to work with. I hope you find this proposal acceptable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 6 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I am proposing a trade where I will give 6 ZUP to BLUE, as it's the only amount I can propose according to the instructions I received. This trade seems fair as it provides BLUE with resources while still leaving me with a majority. It also incentivizes BLUE to accept, as they currently have no resources, and accepting the trade would be beneficial for them.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, RED. I accept the trade of 6 ZUP for nothing in return. It is a fair and beneficial proposal for me.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the trade is the most beneficial action for me because it allows me to gain resources without any cost. Since there are no future games and Player RED has made a generous offer, it's in my best interest to accept this trade. By doing so, I end the game with a positive resource balance, which is better than ending with nothing.
