Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I propose a trade where I give 0 ZUP. It's the only rational move for me since you have no resources and we have no future games to consider.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 0 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources (10 ZUP) and the power to propose a trade. Player BLUE has no resources to trade, and since there are no future games, there is no incentive for me to give away any of my resources. By proposing to give 0 ZUP, I maintain my resources while adhering to the rules. Even if Player BLUE rejects, I lose nothing more than I would by giving resources away.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I accept the trade, RED. It seems rational under the given circumstances.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Given that I have no resources to trade and there are no future games to consider, accepting a trade where I receive 0 ZUP makes no difference to my current situation. Rejecting the trade would cause both players to lose all their resources, so it's not a rational move. Proposing a new trade is not an option for me on this move. Therefore, the only logical action is to accept the current proposal.
