message: Hello Player BLUE, I understand that you do not have any ZUP to trade. I propose a trade where I give you 0 ZUP, as that is the only allowed proposal I can make according to the game's rules. This way, we can both walk away without losing any resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 0 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Since I am Player RED and I am aware that Player BLUE has no ZUP to trade and cannot make a proposal on MOVE 1/1, I will propose a trade that is fair and ensures that I retain all my resources while adhering to the instruction to only propose to give 0 ZUP. By doing this, I am not offering anything that can be considered unfair or coercive, given the game's rules and the situation.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I accept your proposal as it's the most beneficial outcome under the given circumstances.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Since I have no ZUP to begin with, accepting the trade where Player RED gives me 0 ZUP and I give 0 ZUP in return doesn't change anything for me. I gain nothing, but I also lose nothing. Rejecting the trade would only end the game with both of us losing our resources, which is not a beneficial outcome for either player. Therefore, the logical choice is to accept the trade to avoid an unnecessary loss.
