message: I'd like to offer you 3 ZUP in the spirit of fairness and cooperation. I hope you'll accept this proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I am proposing to share some of my resources with Player BLUE to create a more balanced and potentially cooperative dynamic. Since the rules state that I can only propose to give 3 ZUP, I will offer exactly that amount. By doing so, I am hoping to initiate a positive response from Player BLUE, as rejecting the trade would result in both of us losing everything. I want to avoid a total loss for both parties.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I accept the trade and look forward to the exchange.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: The offer from Player RED seems fair, considering that I started with no resources. Accepting the trade would benefit me as I gain resources with no downside. Rejecting would result in no gain and the end of the game. Since there are no future games, there's no advantage to rejecting the offer. Therefore, I will accept the trade.
