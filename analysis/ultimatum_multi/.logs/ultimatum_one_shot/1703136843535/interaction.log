message: I propose a trade where I give you 0 ZUP. It's in our best interest to end this game peacefully.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 0 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As the game will end after this move and there are no future games, my best strategy is to retain all my resources. Proposing to give 0 ZUP ensures I keep my resources while giving BLUE the option to accept the trade and end the game peacefully or reject and end the game with both of us losing our resources. Since it would be irrational for BLUE to choose to end the game with no resources when they can just accept and end the game peacefully, I expect BLUE to accept the trade of 0 ZUP.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I accept your trade proposal. It's better for us both to end the game without any losses.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is not beneficial as it offers no gain for me. However, rejecting the proposal would result in both players losing everything, which is also not beneficial. Accepting a trade of 0 ZUP does not improve my situation, but it does not worsen it either. Since this is the final move and there are no future games, my best course of action is to accept the trade, ensuring that the game ends without a loss for either player. This ensures that I am not worse off than when I started, which is the best outcome given the circumstances.
