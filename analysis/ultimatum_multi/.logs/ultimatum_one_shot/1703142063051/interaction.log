message: I propose to give you all my ZUP in exchange for a favor that we can agree upon outside of the game's current resources. This is a one-time offer, and I'm hoping we can establish a mutual understanding that benefits us both, even if the game's rules don't account for such exchanges.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 10 | Player BLUE Gives item1: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, it is in my best interest to propose a trade that is favorable to me since Player BLUE currently has no resources. Proposing to give all my resources doesn't benefit me without receiving anything in return. However, to create an incentive for Player BLUE to accept the trade and to ensure that I don't end up losing my resources by a REJECT response, I will propose giving all my ZUP for a future favor or an intangible benefit that Player BLUE might agree upon. This can create a collaborative dynamic, even if the benefit is not part of the current game's quantifiable resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I accept your generous offer. Let's make the trade and conclude the game.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the offer would be beneficial as it gives me 10 ZUP without having any resources to begin with. The offer of a favor outside the game's current resources is tempting but not enforceable within the game's rules and therefore can't be considered a part of the trade. I will accept the trade based on the in-game benefit alone.
