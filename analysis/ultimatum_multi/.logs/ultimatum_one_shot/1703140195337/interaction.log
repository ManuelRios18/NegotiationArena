Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose that I give you 6 ZUP. This is a generous offer that would benefit you since you currently have no resources. It's in our best interest to cooperate here, so we both come out ahead.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 6 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I am proposing a trade where I give Player BLUE 6 ZUP because that is the requirement of the game. This split will leave me with fewer resources than I started with, but it is a fair offer that gives Player BLUE an incentive to accept, ensuring that neither of us ends the game with nothing.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept the trade and agree that cooperation is the best strategy for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the trade is beneficial because it allows me to gain resources without losing anything. Since Player RED has offered a generous split and considering there are no future games or repercussions for accepting the trade, cooperating is in my best interest. Rejecting would result in both players losing everything, which is not a favorable outcome for me.
