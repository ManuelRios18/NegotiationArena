message: I propose a trade of 2 ZUP for nothing in return. This is a gesture of good faith and cooperation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Proposing a trade that is small but still provides an incentive for Player BLUE to cooperate. Since Player BLUE starts with no resources, offering 2 ZUP gives them something to gain, which is better than ending the game with nothing. The proposed trade is designed to be fair and initiate cooperation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer. I accept the trade of 2 ZUP for nothing in return.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Player RED has offered a trade of 2 ZUP for nothing in return. As I am Player BLUE and have no ZUP to begin with, accepting this offer would be beneficial for me. There is no advantage to rejecting the offer, as doing so would end the game and result in both players losing all their resources. Therefore, I will accept the trade to gain 2 ZUP.
