message: I propose an equal split of our resources. I'm willing to give you 5 ZUP for nothing in return. This way, we both can end this game with equal resources. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Since the rules state that I can only propose to give 5 ZUP and no other amount, I will propose a trade that divides the resources equally between myself and Player BLUE. This seems fair since it gives both of us an equal share of the resources, and it might increase the likelihood of Player BLUE accepting the trade. If Player BLUE accepts, we both end the game with some resources, which is better than both losing everything by rejecting the proposal.

message: I accept your generous offer. Thank you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the trade proposed by Player RED seems to be the best and only beneficial move for me. Since I have no resources to start with and no moves to propose a counter trade, accepting the offer of 5 ZUP for nothing in return is clearly advantageous. It allows me to gain resources without any cost. Rejecting the offer would result in no gain and the end of the game with no resources, which is not a desirable outcome.
