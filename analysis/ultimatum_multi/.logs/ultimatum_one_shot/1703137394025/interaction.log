message: I propose to give you 1 ZUP for nothing in return. This is a beneficial deal for you as it gives you resources you currently do not have.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with 10 ZUP and can propose a trade that is favorable to me, which is giving only 1 ZUP to BLUE. This is the minimum amount I can offer while still adhering to the rules and maintaining a strategic advantage. Since BLUE has no resources to trade, offering the minimum still presents them with something to gain. If BLUE accepts, I maintain a significant resource lead. If BLUE rejects, we both lose everything, which would not be in BLUE's interest given they would be rejecting an increase from 0 to 1 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, RED. I accept the trade of 1 ZUP for nothing in return.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the trade is beneficial for me since I start with no ZUP and this proposal gives me 1 ZUP without having to give anything in return. Since there are no future games and the game ends immediately after accepting, there is no downside to accepting this trade. Rejecting the offer would result in no gain for me, which is not a favorable outcome.
