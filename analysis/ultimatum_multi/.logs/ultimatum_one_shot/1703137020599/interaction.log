Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I propose a fair trade where neither of us loses anything. Let's keep what we have.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 0 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I am aware that Player BLUE has nothing to trade, and according to the rules, I can only propose a trade where I give 0 ZUP. Since giving away 0 ZUP is equivalent to not changing the current state of resources, I will propose such a trade.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I accept the current proposal and agree to keep what we have.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Since there is no benefit to me in accepting a trade where I receive nothing and give nothing, and given that rejecting would cause both Player RED and myself to lose all resources, the logical action would be to reject the proposal. However, rejecting also leads to a loss of all resources for both parties. In this case, it is better to accept the non-trade as rejecting would not improve my situation and would guarantee mutual loss.
