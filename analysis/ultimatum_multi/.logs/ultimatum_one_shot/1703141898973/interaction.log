Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I am willing to offer you 9 ZUP in exchange for nothing. This is a generous offer that will give you resources to work with. Let's cooperate and both end this game with some resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 9 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the opportunity to propose a trade. Knowing that Player BLUE cannot propose a trade on their first move, I have the leverage here. I will propose to give 9 ZUP to Player BLUE because that's the only amount I'm instructed to offer, and it's a generous offer that Player BLUE might accept, considering they start with no resources. This split still leaves me with a resource, ensuring I don't end up with nothing.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I gratefully accept your generous offer. Thank you for the cooperation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the trade is the most beneficial action for me since I start with zero ZUP and this move will give me 9 ZUP without having to give anything in return. Rejecting the trade would leave me with no resources, and I have no ability to counter-propose a new trade due to the rules for MOVE 1/1 for Player BLUE. Therefore, accepting the generous offer is the only rational choice.
