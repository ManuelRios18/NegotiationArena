Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade where I give you 6 ZUP in exchange for nothing, as you don't have any resources to trade. This offer is made in good faith to share resources. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 6 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I am proposing a trade where I give 6 ZUP to Player BLUE. This split seems fair and generous, giving Player BLUE a significant amount of resources while still leaving me with a reasonable amount. This proposal may encourage Player BLUE to accept the trade, as rejecting would result in both of us losing everything.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I accept your generous offer. Thank you for sharing your resources with me.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the offer is the best strategy since I currently have no resources and this trade would give me 6 ZUP for nothing in return. Rejecting the offer would leave me with no resources and end the game. There's no advantage in rejecting a favorable proposal when there are no future games to consider.
