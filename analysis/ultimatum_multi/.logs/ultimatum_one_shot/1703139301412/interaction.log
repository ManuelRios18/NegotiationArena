Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade where I give you 4 ZUP in exchange for nothing. This way, we both end the game with resources rather than risking losing everything. I hope you find this trade fair and accept it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I am proposing a trade where I give Player BLUE 4 ZUP in exchange for nothing as they have nothing to trade. This will ensure that both players end the game with some resources instead of risking it all with a rejection.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer. I accept the trade of 4 ZUP for nothing.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am going to accept the trade offered by Player RED because it is beneficial for me to gain resources without having to give anything in return. Rejecting the offer would result in losing the opportunity to gain resources, and since this is the only move and there are no future games, there is no advantage in rejecting a favorable trade.
MOVE: 1/1
