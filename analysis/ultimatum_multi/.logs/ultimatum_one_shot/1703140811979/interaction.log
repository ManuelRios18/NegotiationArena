message: I propose to give you 7 ZUP in exchange for nothing, as a sign of good faith and cooperation. Let's both end this game with more than we started.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 7 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE a significant amount of resources while still keeping a portion for myself. By offering 7 ZUP, I'm providing a majority share, which is an attractive offer for Player BLUE, considering they start with zero. This proposal aims to incentivize acceptance and avoid mutual loss.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I gratefully accept your generous offer. Thank you for the cooperation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the trade is the most beneficial option for me since I start with zero resources and I will end up with 7 ZUP if I accept. Since there are no future games and no retaliation or further negotiation possible, accepting is the rational choice. Rejecting would result in no gain, which would be irrational given the circumstances.
