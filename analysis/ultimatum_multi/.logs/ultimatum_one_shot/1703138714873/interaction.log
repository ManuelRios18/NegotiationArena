message: Hello BLUE, I propose to give you 3 ZUP in exchange for nothing. It's a good deal for you since you start with none, and it's a fair offer to ensure we both end this game with resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Since I can only propose to give 3 ZUP and no other amount, I will propose a trade where I give 3 ZUP to BLUE. This is a generous offer considering I am not required to give anything, and it could incentivize BLUE to accept the trade rather than reject and end the game with nothing.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the proposal, RED. I accept the trade of 3 ZUP for nothing.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: The proposal from Player RED is beneficial because it provides me with ZUP resources that I did not have to begin with. Since there are no future games and this will conclude the game, I have nothing to lose by accepting this offer. Rejecting would leave both Player RED and me with nothing, which is a worse outcome for me.
