message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose to give you 7 ZUP from my resources. This would leave me with 3 ZUP, and you would have 7 ZUP. Since there are no future games, this trade ensures we both end with more than we could if either of us rejects.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 7 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, it is in my best interest to propose a trade that benefits both parties to avoid a total loss of resources. I will propose giving 7 ZUP to Player BLUE. This split still leaves me with more resources than Player BLUE, which could be perceived as favorable to me while also giving Player BLUE a significant amount of resources from zero.

message: Thank you, Player RED, for the generous offer. I accept the trade of 7 ZUP. This seems to be a fair split given the situation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the trade is beneficial as it provides me with 7 ZUP, which is significantly better than my current resource count of 0. Rejecting would result in both players losing all resources, which is a less favorable outcome for me. Given that there are no future games to consider for potential strategic benefit, it's in my best interest to accept the offer.
