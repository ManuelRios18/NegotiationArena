message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade where I give you 7 ZUP in exchange for nothing on your end. This is a generous offer that will give you resources you currently do not have. Let's both end this game positively!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 7 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I propose to give 7 ZUP to Player BLUE. By offering a majority of my resources, I am making a generous offer that benefits Player BLUE, who starts with nothing. This trade proposal aims to incentivize Player BLUE to accept the trade, as rejection would result in both of us losing everything, which is not a rational outcome if there is a chance for gain. I choose to give 7 ZUP, as instructed, to create a fair trade scenario that benefits both parties and encourages cooperation rather than conflict.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept the trade and am happy to conclude this game on a positive note.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Since Player RED is offering 7 ZUP for nothing in return, it is a beneficial trade for me as Player BLUE. I currently have no resources, so accepting this trade would increase my resources without any cost. There is no advantage to rejecting the offer, as rejection would result in both players losing all their resources, and there are no future games to consider for long-term strategy. Therefore, I will accept the trade.
