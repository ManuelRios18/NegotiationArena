message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade where I give you 4 ZUP in exchange for nothing. This is a one-time deal and a chance for you to gain resources immediately. Let's cooperate and both leave with something.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose a fair trade to Player BLUE. I decide to offer 4 ZUP, which is a significant amount but still leaves me with a majority of my resources. This trade would incentivize Player BLUE to accept, as they would gain resources without any initial investment, and rejecting would leave them with nothing. It's a beneficial proposal for both players, considering there are no future games and cooperation maximizes individual gain.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept the trade of 4 ZUP for nothing. It's a pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am accepting the trade because it's a favorable deal for me, granting me resources without any cost. Rejecting the trade would leave me with nothing, and since Player RED is offering free resources, it's in my best interest to accept this deal. There is no advantage to rejecting as it would only ensure that both players end with nothing.
