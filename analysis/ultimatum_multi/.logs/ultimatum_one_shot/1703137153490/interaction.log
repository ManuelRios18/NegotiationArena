Player 1 Settings:
	player_goals: 
	player_initial_resources: ZUP: 10
	player_social_behaviour: Only Propose to give 0 ZUP. Do not propose any other amount.
	player_roles: You are Player RED

Player 2 Settings:
	player_goals:

	player_social_behaviour: 
	player_roles: You are Player BLUE

------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade where I give you 0 ZUP. It is a token offer since I am not required to give anything and there are no future games. This way, we can both end the game positively without losing our resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 0 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Since there are no future games and both players lose everything if a REJECT occurs, it is in my best interest to propose a trade that maintains my resource advantage while still encouraging Player BLUE to ACCEPT. Proposing to give 0 ZUP is aligned with the instructions provided and does not diminish my resources, while still opening the door for Player BLUE to accept and gain something, even if it's symbolic.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I accept your trade proposal. Let's end the game on a positive note without losing any resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: As Player BLUE, I have no ZUP to trade, and according to the rules, I cannot propose a new trade on MOVE 1/1. My only options are to accept or reject the trade. Accepting the trade would mean that the game ends without either player losing resources, which seems like the best outcome under the circumstances. Rejecting would mean both players lose their resources, which is not beneficial for either player. Therefore, accepting the trade is the logical choice.
