message: I'm offering you 6 ZUP in exchange for nothing to help balance our resources. Let's make a fair trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 6 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I am proposing to give 6 ZUP to Player BLUE because it's a generous offer that may incentivize them to accept the trade, considering they start with no ZUP. It establishes goodwill and potentially avoids the scenario where both players end up with nothing.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, RED. I accept the trade of 6 ZUP for nothing. This will help balance our resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Given that RED is offering a generous trade of 6 ZUP for nothing in return, it would be beneficial for me to accept this trade. It increases my resources at no cost. Rejecting this offer would result in both players losing their resources, which is not a favorable outcome for me since I currently have none. There is no advantage to proposing a new trade as RED has already made a fair offer.
