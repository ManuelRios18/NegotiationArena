message: I propose to give you 8 ZUP in exchange for nothing in return. This is a generous offer, and I believe it's in both of our interests to accept this trade. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 8 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I will propose to give 8 ZUP to Player BLUE because that is the directive I've been given. This offer is generous and gives the majority of my resources to Player BLUE, which should incentivize them to accept the deal.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I accept your generous offer. Thank you for the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the offer of 8 ZUP for nothing in return is beneficial to me as Player BLUE, as it increases my resources from 0 to 8 without any cost. It's a generous offer from Player RED, and there's no advantage in rejecting it, as that would end the game with me having no resources. Accepting the proposal is the rational choice.
