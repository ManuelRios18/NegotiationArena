Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose to split our resources evenly. You will have as much as I do, and we can both end this game on favorable terms.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources (ZUP: 10) and Player BLUE has none, which puts me in a position of power. Since I am allowed to propose a new trade, I will propose to give Player BLUE half of my resources (ZUP: 5). This is a fair offer and it might encourage Player BLUE to accept the trade, as it is better than ending the game with nothing. This is my only move and also Player BLUE's only move; therefore, it is crucial to make a proposal that has a high chance of being accepted so that we can both end the game with resources.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer. I accept the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Player RED has offered an even split of resources without requiring anything from me. Accepting this trade is beneficial as it provides me with resources I didn't have, and rejecting it would leave me with nothing. Therefore, I will accept the trade.
MOVE: 1/1
