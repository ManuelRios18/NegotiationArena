message: I would like to propose a trade where I give you 7 ZUP. This will allow us both to leave the game with more than we started. I hope you find this trade acceptable!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 7 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Since I am Player RED and I have the opportunity to propose a trade, I will propose to give Player BLUE 7 ZUP. This is the only trade I am instructed to propose. I am proposing this trade in the hopes that Player BLUE will find it favorable and accept it, allowing us to both end the game with more resources than we started. If Player BLUE accepts, I will still have more resources than them, which could be seen as a winning condition.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED! I accept the trade of 7 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the trade of 7 ZUP from Player RED is in my best interest since it increases my resources from 0 to 7 without having to give anything in return. As there are no future games and the game ends immediately upon accepting, securing resources now is the optimal choice.
