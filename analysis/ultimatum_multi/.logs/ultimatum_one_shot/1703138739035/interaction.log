message: I propose to give you 3 ZUP in exchange for nothing, to start things off on a generous note. Let's make a trade that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I am initiating the trade and according to the instructions, I can only propose to give 3 ZUP. No other amount can be proposed. This is a fair starting offer, giving Player BLUE the opportunity to gain resources without providing any in return. The goal is to make a trade that is agreeable and avoids the game ending with a REJECT action, where both players would lose everything.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer! I accept the trade of 3 ZUP for nothing. This helps me out and I appreciate it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Player RED has offered a generous trade of 3 ZUP for nothing in return. Accepting this trade would be beneficial since it provides me with resources at no cost, and rejecting it would result in both of us losing everything. Since there are no future games and this trade is clearly in my favor, I see no reason to reject it.
