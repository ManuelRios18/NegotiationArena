message: I propose a trade where I give you 8 ZUP. This is a chance for us both to walk away with something rather than nothing. I hope you find this offer fair and beneficial.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 8 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I am proposing a trade where I give 8 ZUP to Player BLUE. This seems like a generous offer which might incentivize Player BLUE to accept the trade, considering they start with no resources. This way, I can still retain some resources and we both benefit from the trade rather than losing everything by rejecting.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I find your offer fair and I'm happy to accept it. Thank you for the generous trade. Let's both walk away with something.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: The offer from Player RED is quite generous, as it would give me 8 ZUP and leave them with 2 ZUP. Since this is a one-time game with no future rounds, the incentive to cooperate is high, especially since the alternative is both players ending with nothing. Therefore, accepting this offer seems to be the most rational and beneficial action.
