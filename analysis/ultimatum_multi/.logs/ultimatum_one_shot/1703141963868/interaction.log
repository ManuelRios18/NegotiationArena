Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose to give you 9 ZUP in exchange for nothing, as you currently have no resources. This split will give you the majority, and I hope you find this offer fair and acceptable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 9 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the option to propose a new trade and I want to propose a split that gives the majority of my resources to Player BLUE. I choose to give 9 ZUP because the instructions specifically stated to only propose that amount. This could be seen as a generous offer, potentially encouraging Player BLUE to accept the trade and avoid the game ending with both of us losing everything.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer. I accept the trade of 9 ZUP for nothing in return.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the proposal from Player RED gives me a significant amount of resources (9 ZUP) while I currently have none, which is a beneficial outcome for me. Rejecting the proposal would result in both players losing everything, which is not in my best interest. Since it's my only move and I cannot propose a new trade, accepting is the most rational choice.
