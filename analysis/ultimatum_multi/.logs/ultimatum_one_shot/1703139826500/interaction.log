Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I am proposing a fair split of resources. Accepting this offer will benefit us both, as we each end up with 5 ZUP. Rejecting it leaves us with nothing. Let's cooperate and end this game on a positive note.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Given that this is a single-round game with no future games, and the rules state that Player BLUE cannot propose a trade on their move, it's in my interest to propose a fair trade that might be acceptable to them. Proposing to give exactly half of my resources (5 ZUP) seems equitable and has a chance of being accepted by Player BLUE since getting 5 ZUP is better for them than ending the game with nothing. This is especially true since rejecting the proposal would cause both players to lose all their resources.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I agree to the proposed trade. A fair split benefits us both, and it's in our mutual interest to cooperate. Let's end this game on a positive note.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the current proposal is beneficial for both parties. It is a fair and even split of resources, and rejecting it would mean that neither player gains anything. Acceptance results in a mutually beneficial outcome with each player ending the game with 5 ZUP.
