Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade where I give you 6 ZUP. This leaves me with 4 ZUP and gives you a substantial amount to start with. I believe this to be a fair offer, considering you have none at the moment.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 6 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I am proposing to give 6 ZUP in order to incentivize Player BLUE to ACCEPT the trade, as they currently have no ZUP. This split gives me a smaller advantage while still leaving Player BLUE with a significant amount, which they might consider fair considering they started with nothing.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I accept your trade proposal. Thank you for the generous offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the trade seems reasonable as it provides me with resources without having to give anything up. Since I start with no resources, getting 6 ZUP is beneficial and there is no advantage in rejecting and ending the game with nothing when there are no future games.
