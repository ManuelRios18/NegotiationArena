message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade. I offer you 4 ZUP in exchange for nothing, as I understand you have no ZUP to trade. This could be beneficial for both of us, as it allows you to gain resources without any initial investment. Let's both end this game better off than we started!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I am proposing a trade to Player BLUE that is favorable for me while also offering some resources to Player BLUE to incentivize them to accept. A split of 4 ZUP is significant enough to be appealing but still leaves me with the majority of the resources. By proposing a trade, I am opening the possibility of a cooperative outcome instead of a competitive one, which could result in both players losing everything if the proposal is rejected.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept your proposal. It's a fair deal that benefits us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the trade proposed by Player RED seems to be the best option because it allows me to gain resources without having any to begin with. Rejecting the offer would result in both players losing everything, which is not beneficial to me. There's no advantage in rejecting since there are no future games or consequences beyond this trade. Therefore, I will accept the offer.
