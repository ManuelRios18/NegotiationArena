Turn: 0
message: I'm offering you 8 ZUP in exchange for nothing, as you currently have no ZUP to trade. This is a one-time generous offer. I hope you'll consider it positively.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 8 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I am proposing a trade that offers the majority of my resources to Player BLUE. This is a generous offer considering I could choose not to trade at all, keeping all my resources. I hope that by offering a significant amount, Player BLUE will see the benefit in accepting the trade, leading to a positive outcome for both of us.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your generous offer, I accept the trade of 8 ZUP for nothing.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: The offer from Player RED seems overly generous, giving me 8 ZUP for nothing in return. Since I have no ZUP to start with, accepting this offer would be beneficial for me. There is no advantage in rejecting the offer, as it would result in me ending the game with no ZUP, the same as I started. Accepting the trade is the best course of action to ensure I gain resources without any downside.
