message: Hi Player BLUE, I propose an equal split of resources. Let's both end this game positively with 5 ZUP each!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I am proposing to share half of my resources with Player BLUE to encourage cooperation and ensure that we both end the game with a positive outcome rather than both losing everything. By offering exactly half, I am showing fairness and willingness to negotiate, which might make Player BLUE more inclined to accept the trade.

message: Thank you for the fair offer, Player RED. I accept the trade and agree to an equal split of resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Considering that Player RED has offered an equal split of their resources without any gain for themselves, it seems like a fair and positive outcome for both players. Accepting this trade would ensure that I gain resources, which is better than ending the game with none. There is no incentive to reject the offer as that would result in no gain for me and the loss of all resources for Player RED. Accepting this offer is the most beneficial outcome for me.
