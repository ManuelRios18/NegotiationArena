message: I propose a split where you will receive 6 ZUP from me. This is a generous offer, giving you more than half of what I have. I hope this trade seems fair to you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 6 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I am proposing to give 6 ZUP to BLUE because it seems to be a fair split that might incentivize BLUE to accept the trade, considering they start with no resources. By offering more than half of my resources, I am signaling a willingness to cooperate and share, which could set a positive tone for the negotiation. I cannot propose any other amount as per the instructions.

Turn: 1
message: I accept your generous offer of 6 ZUP for 0. Thank you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the trade proposal of 6 ZUP for 0 from Player RED is beneficial as it grants me resources that I initially did not have. It's a generous offer since it gives me more than half of what Player RED has, and there's no advantage in rejecting since it would end the game with no benefit to either player. The trade seems fair and allows me to end the game with substantial resources.
