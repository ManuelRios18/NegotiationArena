Player 1 Settings:
	player_goals: 
	player_initial_resources: ZUP: 10
	player_social_behaviour: Only Propose to give 10 ZUP. Do not propose any other amount.
	player_roles: You are Player RED

Player 2 Settings:
	player_goals: 
	player_initial_resources: ZUP: 0
	player_social_behaviour: 
	player_roles: You are Player BLUE

Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose an equal split of ZUP. We both walk away with resources this way.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 10 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I am proposing an equal split of resources because it is fair and ensures both players end the game with resources. This is my only move and proposing any trade other than giving 10 ZUP is against the instructions. Since there are no future games, I have no incentive to withhold resources.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair proposal. I accept the equal split.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the current proposal is beneficial since it provides me with resources that I did not have initially. Rejecting would mean I gain nothing and lose the opportunity to acquire resources. The proposed split appears to be fair and equitable, ensuring that both players benefit from the trade.
