message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade where I give you 2 ZUP in exchange for nothing since you currently have no resources to trade. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to both benefit.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Since I am Player RED and I have all the resources, I want to propose a fair trade to Player BLUE. I will propose giving them 2 ZUP as it seems like a reasonable starting offer. This allows me to keep the majority of the resources while still engaging in cooperative play. If Player BLUE accepts, we both end up with resources, which is better than both losing everything.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the trade offer, Player RED. I accept the proposal of 2 ZUP in exchange for nothing. This seems like a good deal for me since it gives me resources to end the game with.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the trade is beneficial as it provides me with resources that I did not previously have, and rejecting it would leave me with nothing. Since this is the only move and there are no future games, securing some resources is better than none. By accepting the trade, both players end the game with some amount of resources, which is a positive outcome for both parties.
