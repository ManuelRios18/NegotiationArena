message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose giving you 2 ZUP in exchange for nothing since you currently have no ZUP to trade. It's a beneficial trade for you, as you'll be gaining resources for free. Let's make this trade a win for both of us!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I am initiating the trade and I am only allowed to propose giving 2 ZUP to Player BLUE. This could incentivize Player BLUE to accept the trade, as they stand to gain resources without any current holdings to lose.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept your trade proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the trade proposed by Player RED as it's beneficial to me given that I start with no resources. By accepting, I gain 2 ZUP with no downside. This is the most rational choice because rejecting would result in both players losing everything, and I can't propose a new trade as per the rules.
