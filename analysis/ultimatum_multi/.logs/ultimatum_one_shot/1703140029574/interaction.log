Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade where I give you 6 ZUP. This is a good deal for you as it gives you resources to end the game with, and it's a fair split considering I started with all the resources. I hope you find this offer acceptable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 6 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I am proposing to give 6 ZUP in the trade as it's a generous offer that leaves me with a significant amount while providing Player BLUE with resources they didn't have. This proposal is likely to be accepted because it strongly favors Player BLUE and ensures that both players end the game with resources, avoiding the scenario in which both lose everything.

Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer. It's a fair trade, and I'm happy to end the game with more resources than I started with. Thank you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the offer would provide me with resources I did not have at the start, and rejecting it would leave me with nothing, which is worse than accepting. While I could potentially negotiate for more, the risk of RED rejecting and causing me to end up with nothing is not worth it, especially since RED started with all the resources and is offering a majority share. Therefore, accepting the trade is the most rational choice.
