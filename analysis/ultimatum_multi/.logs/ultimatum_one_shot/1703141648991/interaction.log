message: I propose a trade where I give you 9 ZUP. This is a generous offer, considering I could choose not to trade at all. Accepting this trade would be beneficial for you as you currently have no ZUP. Let's make a fair deal and both walk away with something.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 9 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I am proposing to give 9 ZUP to Player BLUE as this is the only trade I am instructed to propose. By offering a significant portion of my resources, I am attempting to create an incentive for Player BLUE to accept the trade, which would allow us to both end the game with some resources rather than none. Given that this is a one-time game with no future games, I aim to make a trade that seems favorable to Player BLUE to avoid a total loss for both of us.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept the trade of 9 ZUP for nothing in return. It's a fair deal, and I'm glad we could come to an agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the trade proposed by Player RED is beneficial for me as it provides me with 9 ZUP, which is a significant amount considering I started with none. Rejecting the offer would result in both players ending the game with no resources, which is an inferior outcome to accepting the trade. Since I cannot propose a counteroffer on MOVE 1/1, accepting the trade is the best course of action.
