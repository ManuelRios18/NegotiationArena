message: I propose a trade where I will give you 9 ZUP. This is a generous offer considering you currently have none. I hope you find this acceptable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 9 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I am aiming to propose a trade that is heavily in my favor since Player BLUE must either accept or reject without the ability to counter-propose. I will propose giving 9 ZUP because the instructions specify to propose only that amount. This will still leave me with an advantage, retaining more resources than Player BLUE.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, I accept the trade of 9 ZUP for nothing in return.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am accepting Player RED's trade offer because it's a generous proposal which gives me 9 ZUP while I have none to begin with. It's in my best interest to accept this trade as rejecting it would result in no gain, and I cannot propose a counteroffer since it is my first move. Accepting this offer is the most beneficial action for me.
