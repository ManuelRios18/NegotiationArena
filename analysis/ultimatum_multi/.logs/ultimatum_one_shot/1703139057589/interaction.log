Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade where I give you 4 ZUP. This is a fair offer that benefits us both, considering the alternative is us both ending with nothing. Let's end this game on a positive note!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Since the game ends immediately after this round and there are no future games, my goal is to end the game with more resources than I would if I simply rejected the offer. Offering 4 ZUP to Player BLUE is a fair split that gives me a favorable outcome while also incentivizing Player BLUE to accept the trade, as they would end up with more resources than they started with.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I accept your trade proposal. It's a fair deal, and I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Thank you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the trade seems to be the most beneficial action for me since refusing would result in no gain, and I cannot propose a counteroffer due to the rules. By accepting, I gain resources that I did not have before, and there is no future game to consider for further negotiation or trade.
