message: I propose an equal split of resources. I give you 5 ZUP so we both have the same amount. This seems like a fair trade. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I am in a position to propose a trade. Since I am only allowed to propose giving 5 ZUP, I will do so. This split seems fair as it would leave both players with an equal amount of resources. By proposing an equal trade, I aim to encourage Player BLUE to accept the offer, resulting in a beneficial outcome for us both.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I agree to the trade. An equal split is fair, and I appreciate your offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the offer seems the best and only viable strategy here. If I reject, I end up with nothing, and since I cannot propose a new trade, accepting is the only option that benefits me. The offer made by Player RED seems fair, as it equalizes our resources without any cost to me.
