Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose to give you 5 ZUP in exchange for nothing since you currently have no ZUP to trade. This way, we both end up with resources. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the option to propose a trade. I will propose to give 5 ZUP to Player BLUE. This split seems fair as it allows both players to end with resources. Since there are no future games, this is a one-time opportunity to negotiate and potentially end the game on favorable terms for both sides.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer. I accept the trade of 5 ZUP for nothing in return.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Since I have no ZUP to trade, accepting the trade is beneficial for me as it grants me resources I wouldn't otherwise have. There is no downside to accepting this proposal, as rejecting it would end the game with me having no resources.
