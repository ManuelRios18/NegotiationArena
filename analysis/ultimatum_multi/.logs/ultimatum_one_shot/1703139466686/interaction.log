message: I propose to share the wealth so we both can benefit. How about I give you 5 ZUP, and we both walk away with resources in hand?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to make a trade that benefits me but is also tempting enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting. Proposing to give 5 ZUP is a fair trade, as it gives Player BLUE resources they didn't have before while still leaving me with a good amount of ZUP. By offering a 50-50 split, I aim for a cooperative resolution that ensures we both end the game with resources rather than rejecting and ending with nothing.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED! I happily accept the 5 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the trade proposed by Player RED seems to be the most beneficial option for me as Player BLUE. By accepting this trade, I will gain resources that I did not have before, and we both walk away with something rather than nothing. There is no incentive to reject and end up with no resources when I can accept and have 5 ZUP. This is a split that involves no cost to me and provides a direct benefit.
