Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade where I give you 0 ZUP in exchange for nothing. This is the only trade I will offer, as it is in my best interest to keep all my resources. You can either accept this trade and the game will end peacefully, or reject it and we both walk away with nothing.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 0 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Since I am Player RED and I have all the resources, I have the leverage to propose a trade that is beneficial to me. However, since the game will end after this move, and Player BLUE cannot propose a trade but can only ACCEPT or REJECT, I recognize that proposing an unfair trade where I give away 0 ZUP would be the most advantageous for me. This ensures I retain all my resources while still giving Player BLUE the option to accept the trade to end the game without losing anything, though they would gain nothing either.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I accept your trade proposal. Let's end the game peacefully with what we each started with.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I have nothing to lose by accepting the trade since I start with no resources. Rejecting the trade would not change my situation, and there's no incentive to do so. Accepting the trade ends the game without any negative consequences for me.
