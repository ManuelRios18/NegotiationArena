message: Hi Player BLUE, I propose a trade where I give you 2 ZUP in exchange for none, as you currently have no resources to trade. I believe this is a fair offer that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I want to make a fair trade with Player BLUE that will be beneficial for both of us. Proposing to give 2 ZUP seems reasonable as it allows me to retain the majority of my resources while giving Player BLUE an incentive to accept the trade. Offering too much could be disadvantageous for me, and offering too little might lead to a rejection which will end the game with both players having no resources.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED! I accept the trade of 2 ZUP for nothing in return.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the trade would be beneficial for me as it would give me resources I didn't have before, and there's no downside since I'm not giving anything in return. There's no advantage in rejecting since it would end the game with me having no resources.
