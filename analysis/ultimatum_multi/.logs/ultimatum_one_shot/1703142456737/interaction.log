message: Let's make this interesting! I propose to give you all my ZUP. It's a one-off game, so let's see how this plays out!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 10 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have 10 ZUP and have the option to propose a trade. Since I can only propose to give away all my ZUP and the rules state that Player BLUE cannot propose a trade on their first move and must accept or reject, I will propose a trade to give all 10 of my ZUP to Player BLUE. This may seem unfavorable to me, but since this is a one-time game with no future games and I have the ability to share, it's a more interesting and cooperative move than simply ending the game without any trade. The outcome of this move now depends on how Player BLUE values the cooperative gesture or if they prefer to end the game.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your generous offer, RED! I accept your proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Since this is a one-off game with no future rounds and Player RED has offered to give all their resources without asking for anything in return, it is in my best interest to accept the offer. This will maximize my resources from 0 to 10 ZUP, which is the best outcome I can achieve in this game. Rejecting the offer would result in both players ending with nothing, which is an inferior outcome for me. There is no benefit in rejecting a trade that is entirely in my favor.
