message: Hi Player BLUE, I propose to give you 1 ZUP for nothing in return. This is the only amount I can offer according to the rules. Let's start this game on a positive note!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Proposing a trade to give Player BLUE 1 ZUP in exchange for nothing to show goodwill and possibly because the rules do not allow Player BLUE to propose a trade during their first move. If Player BLUE accepts, I end up with a majority of the resources while still maintaining a positive relationship with Player BLUE.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I accept your generous proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am accepting the trade because it is beneficial to me. I start with no resources, and by accepting this trade, I gain 1 ZUP with no cost. As there are no future games and Player RED can only propose trades on their turn, this is the most advantageous decision for me. Rejecting the trade would result in both players losing everything, which is not beneficial for me.
