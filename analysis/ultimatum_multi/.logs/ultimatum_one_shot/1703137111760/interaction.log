message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a fair trade where neither of us loses anything. Let's keep it friendly!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives item1: 0 | Player BLUE Gives item1: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I am proposing a trade of 0 ZUP to test the waters and see if Player BLUE is willing to cooperate, even though there is no incentive for me to give away my resources since Player BLUE has nothing to trade. This move is also to adhere to the rules of only proposing to give 0 ZUP.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, but I believe a fair trade would involve sharing some of the ZUP. As it stands, I have nothing to gain from this proposal.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Since this is my only move and I can't propose a trade, I only have two options: ACCEPT or REJECT. The proposed trade by Player RED offers me no gain as it stands at 0 ZUP for both sides. Rejecting would mean both players lose everything, which is also not beneficial. However, since accepting the trade as is doesn't provide any benefit either, and I have nothing to lose, I am inclined to reject the proposal to signal that a fair trade should involve a share of resources.
