message: I propose to give you 7 ZUP for free. This way, we both end up with resources. If you accept, you gain something for nothing. I hope you find this offer fair and beneficial.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 7 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the opportunity to propose a new trade. Since I am instructed to only propose giving 7 ZUP, and Player BLUE has no ZUP to trade, I am offering a trade where I give 7 ZUP in exchange for nothing. This is a generous offer that may encourage Player BLUE to ACCEPT the trade, securing a positive outcome for both players, albeit more so for Player BLUE.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept the 7 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the offer made by Player RED as it is beneficial for me. I will gain 7 ZUP without having to give anything in return. There is no strategic advantage to rejecting this offer since rejecting would end the game with me having no resources, and there are no future games to consider for leverage or negotiation.
