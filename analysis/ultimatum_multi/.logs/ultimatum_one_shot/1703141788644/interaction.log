Turn: 0
message: I would like to propose a trade where I give you 9 ZUP. This is a generous offer that would benefit you significantly since you currently have no resources. Let's both end this game positively. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 9 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I am proposing to give 9 ZUP to Player BLUE to incentivize them to accept the trade. By offering the majority of my resources, I am showing goodwill and trying to create a cooperative scenario where both players end up with resources instead of none. I am not proposing any other amount because the instruction specified to only propose giving 9 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept the trade and look forward to ending this game on a positive note!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the offer is the best choice here because it guarantees me a significant gain of resources without having to give anything in return. Rejecting would result in no gain and ending the game with zero resources, which is not beneficial when there is an opportunity to accept a favorable trade.
