Turn: 0
message: I propose that I give you 7 ZUP in exchange for nothing, as a sign of good faith and cooperation. I believe this trade is beneficial for both of us, as it leaves us both with more than we started with.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 7 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I am proposing to give 7 ZUP to Player BLUE in order to incentivize cooperation and ensure that we both end the game with more resources than we started with. Since Player BLUE cannot propose a trade on their first move, it is in my best interest to make a generous offer that they are likely to accept. By offering a majority of my resources, I am signaling a willingness to cooperate and create a positive outcome for both players. Rejecting the trade would result in a lose-lose situation, which is not desirable.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept the 7 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am accepting the trade because it is beneficial for me. I am getting 7 ZUP for nothing in return. This leaves me with a positive amount of resources, and since there are no future games, I have no incentive to reject a favorable offer.
