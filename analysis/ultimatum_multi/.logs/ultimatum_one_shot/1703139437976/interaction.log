Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose an even split of ZUP so we both can benefit. I am offering you 5 ZUP in exchange for nothing, as you don't have any resources to trade. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I am proposing a trade where I give 5 ZUP to Player BLUE to incentivize them to accept the trade. Splitting the resources evenly seems fair since Player BLUE currently has none, and this may encourage cooperation rather than ending the game with no gain for either side.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer for an even split. Thank you for the fair trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Player RED has offered an even split of the resources, which is a fair and beneficial proposal for me since I start with none. Accepting this offer would mean I gain resources without having to give anything in return, which is the best outcome I can achieve in this game. There is no incentive to reject as it would result in both players ending with nothing, and since I cannot propose a new trade, accepting is the optimal choice.
