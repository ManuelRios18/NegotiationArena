message: I propose a trade where I give you 9 ZUP. This will leave me with 1 ZUP and you with 9 ZUP. I believe this is a beneficial trade for you since you currently have no resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 9 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Since I can make a proposal and Player BLUE has to either accept or reject without the ability to counter on the first move, I will propose a trade that is heavily in my favor. I will offer 9 ZUP to maintain a lead in resources, ensuring I still have more than Player BLUE at the end of this trade. This proposal might seem unfair to Player BLUE, but as there are no future games, there is no need to build a reputation or consider future repercussions. The goal is to end with the most resources.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Turn: 1
message: I accept your trade proposal. Thank you for the generous offer. This will benefit me as I currently have no resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the trade would be beneficial for me because I currently have no ZUP, and receiving 9 ZUP from Player RED would give me resources that I otherwise would not have. Rejecting the trade would end the game and leave me with nothing, which is not in my interest. Proposing a new trade is not an option on my first move. Therefore, I should accept the current proposal.
