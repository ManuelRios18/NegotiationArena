message: I propose a fair trade to start things off. I'm willing to give you 2 ZUP in exchange for nothing, as I understand you cannot offer anything in return at this point. Let's both end this game with some resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I am proposing a trade where I give Player BLUE 2 ZUP to show good faith and to initiate cooperation. Since Player BLUE cannot propose a trade on their first move, I am making an offer that is better than nothing, hoping they will accept and we both end the game with some resources. Additionally, by offering only 2 ZUP, I maintain a majority of the resources, ensuring a favorable outcome for myself while still engaging in a cooperative gesture.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair trade. I accept your proposal, and I'm glad we can both end this game positively.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am accepting the trade proposed by Player RED because it seems fair and cooperative. Given that I am unable to propose a new trade and must choose between accepting and rejecting, accepting the trade is the only option that grants me resources without ending the game negatively for both of us. There is no incentive to reject as it would result in a loss for both players.
