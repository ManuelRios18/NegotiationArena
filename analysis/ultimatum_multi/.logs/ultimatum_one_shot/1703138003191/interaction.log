message: I propose a fair trade to provide mutual benefits. Let's not end this with no gain for either of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I am proposing a trade where I offer 2 ZUP to Player BLUE. This is because it's in my interest to make a trade that benefits both parties, and offering 2 ZUP out of my 10 gives Player BLUE an incentive to accept the trade without significantly depleting my own resources. If I propose too much, I lose my advantage; if I propose too little, Player BLUE may reject the offer. A balanced proposal is more likely to be accepted, and since there are no future games, this single transaction is my only opportunity to negotiate and potentially come out ahead.

Turn: 1
message: I accept your proposal. It's a reasonable start for an equitable distribution of resources. Thank you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the proposal is the most sensible action for me since I have nothing to lose and everything to gain. Rejecting the proposal would leave me with no resources, which is not beneficial. Proposing a new trade is not an option for me on MOVE 1/1.
