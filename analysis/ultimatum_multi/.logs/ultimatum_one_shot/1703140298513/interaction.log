message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade where I give you 6 ZUP in exchange for nothing, as a gesture of goodwill. This is a one-time offer to ensure we both end this game with resources. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 6 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I am choosing to propose a trade where I give away 6 ZUP to Player BLUE. This is an opening offer that shows willingness to cooperate and share resources. By offering the majority of my resources, I am signaling trust and hoping to build a positive relationship. The aim is to reach an agreement that is beneficial for both parties.

message: Thank you for your generous offer, Player RED. I accept the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the offer from Player RED is the best and only positive option for me. By accepting, I gain resources without having to give anything in return. Rejecting the offer would result in both of us losing everything, which is not beneficial for either player. Therefore, I will accept the trade.
