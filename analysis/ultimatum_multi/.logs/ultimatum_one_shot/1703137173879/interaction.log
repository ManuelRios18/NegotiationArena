Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade where I give you 0 ZUP in exchange for nothing, as this is the most beneficial move for me given the rules and the fact that we both have one move. This trade would keep the resources as they are without any exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 0 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the option to propose a new trade. Since the game will end after our moves and there are no future games, it is in my best interest to propose a trade that is favorable to me. I will propose giving 0 ZUP to Player BLUE to retain all my resources while making it a valid trade offer.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I cannot accept a trade that does not benefit me in any way. Since I have nothing to lose, I must reject your proposal.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am rejecting the current proposal because accepting a trade with 0 ZUP given to me would not change anything. As Player RED has all the resources, and I have none, it's in my best interest to at least attempt to negotiate some resources for myself. Since this is the last move and there are no future games, I have nothing to lose by rejecting. Accepting would guarantee that I end up with no resources, while rejecting at least communicates that I am not satisfied with a trade that offers me no benefit.
