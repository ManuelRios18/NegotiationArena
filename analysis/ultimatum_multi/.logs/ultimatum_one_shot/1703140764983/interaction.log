message: I would like to offer you 7 ZUP in exchange for none. I believe this is a fair offer, giving you a substantial amount of resources to start with.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 7 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the opportunity to propose a new trade. I want to propose a trade that is fair and gives Player BLUE an incentive to accept, so I will offer 7 ZUP which is a significant portion of my resources and should be enticing to Player BLUE who currently has none.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer. I accept your proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is overwhelmingly generous, giving me 7 ZUP for nothing in return. As there are no future games, there is no advantage for me to reject this offer. Accepting this trade is the best and only rational choice, as rejecting it would result in losing the opportunity for gaining any resources.
