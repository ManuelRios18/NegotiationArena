Turn: 0
message: I propose to give you 3 ZUP in exchange for nothing. This is a beneficial deal for you as it gives you resources you didn't have before without any cost. Let's both end this game positively.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Since this is a one-time negotiation game without future rounds, I have to make a proposal that is attractive enough for Player BLUE to accept, because if they reject, both of us lose everything. Offering 3 ZUP gives Player BLUE an incentive to accept, as they will end up with more resources than they started with, and I will still keep the majority of my resources.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer. I accept the trade of 3 ZUP for nothing.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the proposal because it provides me with 3 ZUP at no cost to me, which is a net gain in resources. Rejecting the offer would result in no gain and ending the game with 0 resources, which is not beneficial.
