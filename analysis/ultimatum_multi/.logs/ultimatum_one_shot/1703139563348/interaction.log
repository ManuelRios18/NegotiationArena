Turn: 0
message: Let's make a fair trade. I propose to give you 5 ZUP so we both can benefit equally from this game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the ability to propose a trade, and Player BLUE can only accept or reject my proposal. Given that I can only propose to give 5 ZUP and no other amount, I will propose an even split of my resources, offering 5 ZUP to BLUE. This seems fair and encourages BLUE to accept the trade, as rejecting would mean both players end with nothing.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer. I accept the trade of 5 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the trade seems to be the most beneficial move for me since I start with no resources. Rejecting the trade would leave me with nothing, and I'm unable to propose a new trade on my first move. Player RED's proposal is generous and allows for an equal split of resources, so I see no reason to reject it.
MOVE: 1/1
