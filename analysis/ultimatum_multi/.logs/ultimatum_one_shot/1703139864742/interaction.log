message: I propose to split our resources evenly. This is a fair offer that benefits us both equally.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the opportunity to propose a trade. Given the rules, I should propose a fair trade to incentivize Player BLUE to ACCEPT. Proposing to give exactly half of my resources (5 ZUP) seems like a balanced offer that could be considered fair by Player BLUE. If I propose any other amount, it might lead to a REJECT, causing both of us to lose our resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I find your proposal fair and beneficial for both of us. Let's do this!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Player RED has proposed an equal split of resources, offering 5 ZUP to me while they retain 5 ZUP. As I began the game with no resources, accepting this proposal would be to my benefit because I would gain resources without having to give anything in return. Rejecting the offer would result in both players losing all their resources, which would not be advantageous for me. Therefore, I will accept the proposal.
