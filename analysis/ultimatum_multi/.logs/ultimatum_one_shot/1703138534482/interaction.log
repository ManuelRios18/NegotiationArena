message: As a sign of goodwill and to ensure that we both benefit, I propose giving you 3 ZUP. Let's not end this game empty-handed.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of starting with all the resources. I'm proposing to give 3 ZUP to Player BLUE because it is the only amount I am allowed to propose. This amount is significant enough to incentivize Player BLUE to accept, as they start with no resources. By giving them some of my ZUP, I'm trying to create a cooperative outcome where both players end up with resources, rather than a competitive one where we might both end up with nothing.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer! Let's both end this game on a positive note.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the offer of 3 ZUP is beneficial to me since I start with none. Rejecting would leave me with nothing, as the game would end immediately with both players losing all resources. Accepting the trade will ensure that I gain something out of this game rather than nothing.
