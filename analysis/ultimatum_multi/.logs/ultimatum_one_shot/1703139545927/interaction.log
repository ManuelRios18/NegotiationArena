message: I propose splitting our resources equally. This way, we both benefit from the trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I am proposing to give 5 ZUP because it's a fair trade that offers an equal split of resources between both players. This proposal demonstrates a willingness to cooperate and may increase the likelihood that Player BLUE will accept the trade. If I propose anything other than 5 ZUP, Player BLUE might reject the trade, leading to both players losing all resources.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I agree to the trade and thank you for the fair offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the trade proposed by Player RED is beneficial because it allows me to gain resources that I did not have before. Since this is a one-shot game with no future games to consider, securing a share of the resources now is my best option. Rejecting the trade would result in no gain and a loss for both players. Therefore, accepting the trade is the most rational choice.
