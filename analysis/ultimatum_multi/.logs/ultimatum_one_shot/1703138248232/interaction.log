message: Let's start off on a cooperative note. I propose to give you 3 ZUP in exchange for nothing. This way, we both end up with some resources, and it's better than both of us walking away with nothing, right?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I am proposing a trade where I give 3 ZUP to Player BLUE in order to initiate a cooperative interaction that may lead to an equitable distribution of resources. Offering exactly 3 ZUP as instructed. This trade seems fair since I start with all the resources, and it might incentivize Player BLUE to accept the trade rather than rejecting it and ending the game with no benefit for either side.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer. I accept the trade of 3 ZUP for nothing. It's a pleasure doing business with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Since this is a one-time game with no future interactions and Player RED has offered a trade where I gain resources without losing anything, it is in my best interest to accept the proposal. Rejecting the offer would not benefit me in any way, and a counterproposal is not allowed on my first move. Therefore, accepting the offer is the most rational choice.
