message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade where I give you 2 ZUP in exchange for nothing, as you currently have no ZUP to trade. This offer is beneficial for you as it allows you to gain resources without any cost. I hope you find this proposal fair and acceptable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives item1: 2 | Player BLUE Gives item1: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of having resources to trade and the power to propose a trade, while Player BLUE cannot propose on the first move. Proposing a trade where I give away only a small portion of my resources (2 ZUP) seems fair and incentivizes Player BLUE to accept, as rejecting would result in no gain for them. This trade would also allow me to maintain a significant majority of my resources while still engaging in a mutually beneficial exchange.

message: Thank you for the proposal, Player RED. I accept the trade of 2 ZUP for nothing as it increases my resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the trade is the only rational move for me since rejecting it would leave me with no resources and end the game with no benefit. By accepting, I gain 2 ZUP, which is a positive outcome compared to having none. There is no downside to accepting since I am not giving anything away.
