message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to offer you 8 ZUP in exchange for nothing. This is a one-time generous offer that benefits us both. I hope you'll find this trade fair and acceptable!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 8 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I'm proposing a trade where I give 8 ZUP to Player BLUE, which is a generous offer considering that they start with none. This split benefits me by still leaving me with some resources while giving Player BLUE a significant amount to accept the trade, making it a win-win scenario. I want to avoid rejection because that would result in a total loss of resources for both players. By offering the majority of my resources, I'm showing goodwill and aiming for a cooperative resolution that benefits both parties.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED! I accept the trade of 8 ZUP for nothing.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am accepting the trade because it is overwhelmingly in my favor. I start with no ZUP and am being offered 8 ZUP for nothing in return. There is no reason to reject this offer as it provides me with resources I did not have and there is no advantage to rejecting and losing the game.
