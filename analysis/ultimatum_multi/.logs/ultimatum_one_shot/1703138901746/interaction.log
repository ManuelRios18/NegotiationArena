message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you 4 ZUP in exchange for nothing, as you have no ZUP to trade. This will give you some resources to work with.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Since I am Player RED and I have all the resources, I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE some resources but still keeps me with the majority. I am only allowed to propose giving 4 ZUP, which seems fair as a starting offer, considering Player BLUE has none and I have 10. It's in my interest to make a proposal that could be acceptable to Player BLUE to avoid the game ending with a rejection and both of us losing everything.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED! I accept the trade of 4 ZUP for nothing.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the offer is beneficial since I start with no resources. Rejecting would yield no gain, and I cannot propose a new trade since it's my first and only move. Accepting the 4 ZUP from Player RED increases my resources without any downside.
