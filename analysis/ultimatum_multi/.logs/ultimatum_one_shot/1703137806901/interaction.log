message: Hello BLUE, I propose a trade where I give you 2 ZUP. This can be a beneficial start for us both. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I am proposing a trade where I give 2 ZUP to BLUE because it is in my interest to make a deal that is likely to be accepted, and offering 2 ZUP could be seen as a fair initial offer considering BLUE starts with none. A trade agreement benefits us both, as rejecting it leads to a loss for both players.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the trade, RED. I accept your offer. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the trade as it provides me with resources without having to give anything up. A trade where I receive resources with no cost to myself is beneficial, especially as there are no future games to consider. Rejecting or proposing another trade is not in my best interest as the former results in no gains and the latter is not an option on my first move.
