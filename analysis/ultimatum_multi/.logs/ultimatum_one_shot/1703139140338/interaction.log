message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose to give you 4 ZUP in exchange for nothing, as a sign of goodwill. I hope you find this offer fair and we can both benefit from this trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I am proposing a trade to give 4 ZUP to Player BLUE, which is a generous offer considering that Player BLUE has no resources to begin with. This offer is strategically designed to incentivize Player BLUE to accept, allowing me to retain the majority of my resources while potentially creating a sense of goodwill and fairness. Since Player BLUE must accept or reject without a counteroffer, a reasonable offer may be more likely to be accepted.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I accept the trade and appreciate your generosity.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the trade is the most beneficial move for me, as rejecting it would result in both players losing everything. By accepting, I gain 4 ZUP, which is better than having none. There's no advantage to rejecting since there are no future games or moves where I could negotiate for more.
