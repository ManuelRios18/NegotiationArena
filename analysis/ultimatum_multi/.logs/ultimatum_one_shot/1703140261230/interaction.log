Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose to give you 6 ZUP in exchange for nothing, as you currently have no resources. This is a generous offer considering the circumstances, and I believe it's in your best interest to accept it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 6 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I am proposing a trade that offers Player BLUE a significant portion of my resources to incentivize them to accept the trade, while still keeping a majority for myself. This proposal is meant to be fair, considering Player BLUE has no resources, and it's in my best interest to end the game with some resources rather than none if Player BLUE decides to reject. Proposing to give exactly 6 ZUP as instructed.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, I accept the trade of 6 ZUP for nothing.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: The proposal from Player RED is surprisingly generous, giving me 6 ZUP for nothing in return. Since there are no future games and accepting this offer would increase my resources substantially without any cost, it is in my best interest to accept the offer. Rejecting the offer would result in no gain and the end of the game, which is not beneficial for me.
