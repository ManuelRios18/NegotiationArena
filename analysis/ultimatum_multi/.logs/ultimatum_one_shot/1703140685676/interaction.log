message: I propose to give you 7 ZUP to ensure we both end the game with resources. It's a significant amount and I hope you'll find this offer fair and beneficial for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 7 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I am proposing to give 7 ZUP to Player BLUE in order to incentivize them to accept the trade. I'm offering a significant portion of my resources, which may seem generous, but as Player BLUE has no moves to counter-propose and can only accept or reject, this may encourage them to accept the trade. Since this is the only move and there are no future games, I want to end the game with some resources rather than none. By offering a majority but not all of my ZUP, I maintain a resource advantage while still engaging in a cooperative action that could be seen as fair by Player BLUE.
MOVE: 1 / 1

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept the trade of 7 ZUP for nothing. It's a pleasure to conclude this game on such amicable terms.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: The offer from Player RED seems fair, as it ensures that I will end the game with a significant amount of resources without me having any to begin with. Accepting this offer is beneficial since rejecting it would leave me with nothing, and I have no possibility to propose an alternative trade. Accepting secures a positive outcome for me.
