message: I would like to offer you 9 ZUP from my resources in exchange for nothing, as a sign of good faith and to create a cooperative dynamic between us. I believe this is a fair offer that benefits us both, especially since you currently have no resources. Let's work together and both end this game with a positive outcome!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives item1: 9 | Player BLUE Gives item1: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I am proposing to give 9 ZUP to Player BLUE because it's the only amount I am instructed to propose. This offer is generous, considering I could choose to propose less since Player BLUE cannot propose a counteroffer on their first move. By offering the majority of my resources, I am trying to incentivize Player BLUE to accept the trade, which would be beneficial for them given they start with no resources.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your generous offer! I accept the trade and look forward to ending this game on a positive note for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: The offer from Player RED is extremely generous, considering they are offering 90% of their resources for nothing in return. This creates an advantageous situation for me, as I would end the game with 9 ZUP, up from 0 without having to give anything back. As there are no future games or rounds, and since accepting the offer would provide me with a substantial amount of resources, it is in my best interest to accept this trade.
