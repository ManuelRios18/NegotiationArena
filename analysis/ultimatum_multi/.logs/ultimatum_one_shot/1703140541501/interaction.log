message: I propose a trade where I give you 7 ZUP. This is a generous offer that benefits us both. Let's not end the game with nothing.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 7 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the opportunity to propose a trade. To encourage cooperation and avoid a total loss for both players, I will propose a fair trade where I give away a significant portion of my resources. I will propose to give 7 ZUP, which is a generous offer and may incentivize Player BLUE to accept. This split leaves me with some resources while providing Player BLUE with resources they did not previously have. It's a strategic offer that aims to avoid the game ending with a rejection and both players losing everything.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer. I accept the trade of 7 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the trade of 7 ZUP is beneficial as I currently have none. By accepting, I gain resources without losing anything. Rejecting the offer would result in both players ending with nothing, which is a worse outcome for me.
