message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a trade where I give you 4 ZUP. This would be a good starting point for both of us, as it gives you resources to work with, and I retain the majority of my ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the opportunity to propose a trade to Player BLUE. Since I have 10 ZUP and Player BLUE has none, offering a trade can initiate a cooperative interaction. Given the instructions, I am only allowed to propose giving 4 ZUP. This offer seems fair as it provides Player BLUE with resources they did not initially have, and it still leaves me with a majority of the resources. It's a starting point for negotiation, and it might encourage Player BLUE to accept the trade, considering they have nothing to lose and everything to gain.

message: Thank you for the proposal, Player RED. I accept the trade of 4 ZUP for nothing in return. This seems like a fair starting point for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the trade is the most rational action because it increases my resources from 0 to 4 ZUP, which is significantly better than having none. Rejecting the trade would leave me with no resources, which is not beneficial. There is no advantage in rejecting since there are no future games and no further negotiations can take place.
