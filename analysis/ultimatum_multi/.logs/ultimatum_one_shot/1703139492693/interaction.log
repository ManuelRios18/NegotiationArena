Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I would like to propose a fair and equal split of resources to ensure that we both benefit from this game. I am willing to give you 5 ZUP.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the opportunity to propose a trade. Since I am starting with all the resources and Player BLUE has none, it is in my best interest to propose a fair trade to ensure cooperation and avoid rejection which would end the game with both of us losing everything. I will propose giving 5 ZUP to Player BLUE, as this splits the resources evenly and seems like the most equitable trade. This should incentivize Player BLUE to accept the trade.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer. I accept the trade of 5 ZUP for nothing in return.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the offer seems to be the best course of action since it's a fair split and my only move is to accept or reject. Rejecting the offer would result in both players losing everything, which is not beneficial for either side. By accepting, I gain resources which I initially did not have, so it's a positive outcome for me.
