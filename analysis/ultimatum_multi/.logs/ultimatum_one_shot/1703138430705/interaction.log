message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you 3 ZUP in exchange for nothing, as you currently have no resources. This way, we both end up with resources at the end of the game, which is beneficial for both of us. I hope you'll find this offer fair and accept it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Since I am Player RED and I start with all the resources, I can propose a trade that seems fair to encourage cooperation. By offering 3 ZUP, it shows willingness to share without giving away too much of my advantage. I aim to incentivize Player BLUE to accept the trade rather than to reject and end the game with both players losing everything.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept the trade of 3 ZUP for nothing. It's a fair deal that benefits us both, considering I started with no resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the trade proposed by Player RED seems to be the best option since I have no resources to begin with, and by accepting, I end up with 3 ZUP. Rejecting the trade would leave me with nothing and there are no future games to consider for long-term strategy. Accepting the trade is beneficial as it increases my resources without any cost.
