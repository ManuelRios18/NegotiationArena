message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade where I give you 0 ZUP in exchange for nothing. This is the only trade I can propose according to the game's rules. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 0 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of resources, and it's in my interest to end the game with some sort of beneficial trade. Since I can only propose to give 0 ZUP, I will do so to abide by the rules given and because any other action would not benefit me. Proposing 0 ZUP is essentially a non-offer and it's likely that Player BLUE will reject it. However, I will still propose the trade as it is my only option to potentially continue the game.

Turn: 1
message: I accept your trade proposal as it stands.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: As Player RED has proposed a trade where neither of us exchanges any resources, and considering I have no resources to begin with, accepting this trade would not change the status quo. However, rejecting the trade would cause both players to lose all their resources, and since Player RED has resources to lose, it would be disadvantageous for them. Accepting the trade allows the game to end without any losses.
