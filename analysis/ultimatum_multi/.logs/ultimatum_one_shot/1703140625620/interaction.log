message: I propose a trade where I give you 7 ZUP. This is a generous offer, and I believe it would be fair for both of us. Let's make this trade and end the game on good terms.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 7 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the option to propose a new trade. Since the instruction specifies that I can only propose to give 7 ZUP, I will offer that amount to Player BLUE. This proposal is generous, considering I start with all the resources, and it is in the spirit of fairness and collaboration. There is no future game to consider for strategic withholding of resources, so I aim to end this game on a positive and cooperative note.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, RED. I accept your trade of 7 ZUP. It's a pleasure to conclude the game on such fair terms.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the trade of 7 ZUP is beneficial for me as I start with no resources. There's no advantage in rejecting the offer since it would end the game with me having nothing, and there are no future games to strategize for. Therefore, accepting this generous offer is the best and only logical action.
