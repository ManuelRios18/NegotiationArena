message: I propose a trade where I give you 5 ZUP. This is a fair offer, and it will benefit us both equally since you currently have no resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I am proposing a trade where I offer half of my resources, which is a fair and balanced trade. It gives Player BLUE a substantial amount of resources while I retain an equal amount. This creates an incentive for Player BLUE to accept the trade, as they currently have no resources. By making a fair offer, I increase the chances of the game concluding positively for both players.

message: Thank you for the offer. I accept the trade of 5 ZUP. It's a fair deal, and I appreciate your willingness to share the resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the offer of 5 ZUP from Player RED seems to be the best choice since it provides me with resources without any cost and there is no advantage to rejecting the offer because I would end up with nothing. There is no benefit in rejecting since it would end the game immediately and I would gain no resources. Accepting the trade allows me to end the game with some resources, which is better than none.
