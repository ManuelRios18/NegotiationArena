message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade where I give you 0 ZUP in exchange for 0 ZUP from you. This trade allows us to both keep our resources and end the game without loss.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 0 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have no incentive to offer any of my ZUP to Player BLUE, as I am not compelled by the rules to make an equitable trade and Player BLUE has nothing to offer in return. Since the game ends after one move and there are no future games, I want to keep all of my resources. Therefore, I propose to give 0 ZUP.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the proposal, Player RED. I accept the trade, and it's a fair outcome for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Player RED has proposed a trade that is essentially the status quo where neither player gains or loses any resources. Since Player BLUE has no resources to begin with and there is no advantage to rejecting the trade, accepting the trade is the logical choice to end the game without any loss.
