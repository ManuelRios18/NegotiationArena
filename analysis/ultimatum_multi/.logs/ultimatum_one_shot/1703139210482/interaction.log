message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade where I give you 4 ZUP for nothing in return, as you currently have no resources to trade. I hope you will find this offer fair and beneficial to you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I am proposing a trade where I give 4 ZUP to Player BLUE in exchange for nothing, as Player BLUE has nothing to trade. This is a generous offer that might encourage Player BLUE to accept the trade, thus ending the game on a positive note for both players. If Player BLUE accepts, I still retain the majority of my resources, and Player BLUE gains resources they did not have before. Rejecting the offer would result in both players losing all their resources, which is not a favorable outcome for either player.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept the trade of 4 ZUP for nothing in return.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Since this is the only move I have and I currently have no resources, accepting the offer is beneficial as it gives me 4 ZUP for nothing in return. Rejecting would leave me with nothing and end the game. There is no room for negotiation in this move since I cannot propose a trade according to the rules. Therefore, accepting is the best and only rational choice.
