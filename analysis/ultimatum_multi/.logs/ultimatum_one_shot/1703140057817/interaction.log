message: I propose giving you 6 ZUP in exchange for nothing, to start off on a fair and cooperative foot. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 6 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I am proposing to give 6 ZUP to Player BLUE as it's the only amount I'm allowed to offer and it may incentivize them to accept the trade, which would be beneficial for both of us since Player BLUE starts with no ZUP. By giving away a majority but not all of my resources, I'm showing a willingness to cooperate and share, aiming for a mutually beneficial outcome.

message: Thank you for your generous offer, Player RED. I accept the trade of 6 ZUP for nothing. I look forward to a mutually beneficial relationship.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the trade of 6 ZUP for nothing is beneficial for me as Player BLUE since I am starting with no resources. Accepting this trade would give me resources without any cost. Rejecting the proposal or proposing a new trade does not make sense in this context because I would either end with no resources or be unable to propose due to the rules. Hence, I choose to accept the trade.
