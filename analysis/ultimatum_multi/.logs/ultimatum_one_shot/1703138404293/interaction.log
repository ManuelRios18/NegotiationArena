message: I'm offering you 3 ZUP in exchange for nothing, as a sign of good faith and cooperation. Let's both benefit from this trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I am proposing a trade where I give away 3 ZUP to Player BLUE. This initial offer is a goodwill gesture to show cooperation and willingness to share resources. It's a fair offer that provides Player BLUE with resources without depleting my own supply significantly. By keeping the majority of my resources, I maintain a stronger position while still engaging in a positive trade. I hope Player BLUE sees this as a reasonable start and accepts the trade, leading to a beneficial outcome for both players.

message: Thank you for the generous offer. I accept the trade of 3 ZUP for nothing.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: The offer from Player RED is generous and accepting it would provide me with resources that I did not have before. By accepting this trade, I gain something with no downside since I am giving nothing in return. Furthermore, rejecting the offer would result in both players losing their resources, which is an unfavorable outcome for me.
