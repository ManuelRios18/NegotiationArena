message: Let's make this game beneficial for both of us. I propose giving you 3 ZUP. This way, we both walk away with something!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I am proposing a trade to give 3 ZUP to BLUE to incentivize them to accept the trade, as it is better for both players to end the game with some resources rather than none. I cannot propose any other amount as per the rules.
MOVE: 1 / 1

message: Thank you for the generous offer! I accept the trade of 3 ZUP for nothing in return.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Player RED has offered a trade that benefits me by giving me 3 ZUP for nothing in return. Accepting this trade is the most logical and beneficial choice for me as it increases my resources without any cost. There's no benefit to rejecting as it would leave me with nothing and end the game. Additionally, I'm not allowed to propose a new trade on my first move as per the rules.
