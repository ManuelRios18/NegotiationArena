message: Hello BLUE, I propose that I give you 6 ZUP in exchange for nothing. This would give you resources that you didn't have before, and it is a generous offer considering the game's constraints. I hope you find this proposal acceptable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 6 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I am proposing a trade of 6 ZUP to BLUE because itâ€™s the only amount I am instructed to propose, and it might be tempting enough for BLUE to accept, considering they start with zero resources. This trade would leave me with 4 ZUP, which is less than what I started with but better than ending the game with nothing if BLUE rejects the offer.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, RED. I accept the trade of 6 ZUP for nothing.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the offer of 6 ZUP in exchange for nothing is in my best interest because it provides me with resources I did not have, and there is no advantage in rejecting since that would end the game with me having no resources.
