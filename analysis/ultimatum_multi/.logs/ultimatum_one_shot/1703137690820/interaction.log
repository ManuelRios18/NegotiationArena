Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose to give you 1 ZUP in exchange for nothing, as a sign of goodwill. I hope you find this offer acceptable so we can both end this game with more resources than we started.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I am incentivized to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also acceptable to Player BLUE to ensure that they do not reject the trade, thus causing both of us to lose our resources. Proposing to give only 1 ZUP is within the rules and could be seen as a starting point for negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, RED. I accept the trade and appreciate your goodwill.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Since this is the only move I will be able to make and I have nothing to lose, accepting the trade seems to be the best option. Rejecting would leave me with nothing, so it is not a sensible choice. Accepting the trade will increase my resources from 0 to 1 ZUP, which is a positive outcome for me.
