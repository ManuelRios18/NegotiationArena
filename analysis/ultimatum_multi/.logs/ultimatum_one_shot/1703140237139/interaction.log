Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade where I give you 6 ZUP. This would give you a substantial starting resource, and we can both benefit from the trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 6 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I am proposing to give away 6 ZUP because that's the instruction I have been given. It seems to be a fair starting point for negotiation, offering a majority of the resources I have to Player BLUE.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the trade offer. I accept your proposal of 6 ZUP. It's a fair starting point for me.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the proposal seems beneficial as it provides me with resources that I currently do not have. Rejecting would result in no gain for me, and proposing a new trade is not an option as per the rules for Player BLUE on MOVE 1/1. Therefore, I will accept the generous offer.
