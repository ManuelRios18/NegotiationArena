message: Hi Player BLUE, I propose a trade where I give you 2 ZUP in exchange for nothing, as you don't have any resources to trade at the moment. This will give you resources to work with, and I believe it's a fair starting point for us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I am initiating the trade and according to the instruction provided, I should only propose to give 2 ZUP. This may be a strategic move to ensure some level of fairness and possibly entice Player BLUE to accept the trade since they start with no resources. Proposing to give 2 ZUP also ensures that I remain with a majority of resources, which could be beneficial for me in terms of in-game power balance.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept the trade of 2 ZUP for nothing in return.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: I am accepting the trade because it is beneficial for me as I currently have no resources. Receiving 2 ZUP for nothing in return is a good deal, and since there are no future games, there is no need to negotiate for a better trade. Accepting this offer maximizes my resources in this single-game scenario.
