message: Let's make a trade where you end up with some resources instead of none. I propose giving you 3 ZUP. This way, we both benefit.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: I am proposing to give 3 ZUP to Player BLUE to incentivize them to accept the trade. This way, we both end up with more resources than we would if the game ends with rejection, as rejection leads to both players losing everything.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the trade, I accept the 3 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the trade proposed by Player RED seems to be the best option because it results in a positive outcome for me, as I will have more resources than I currently do, which is none. Rejecting the trade would leave me with no resources, and there is no benefit in doing so since there are no future games where I could potentially use a rejection as leverage.
