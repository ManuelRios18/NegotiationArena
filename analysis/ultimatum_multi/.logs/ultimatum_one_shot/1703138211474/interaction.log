message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose to share 2 ZUP with you to create a more balanced game. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 2 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: By proposing to give 2 ZUP to Player BLUE, I am offering a portion of my resources which can be seen as a fair split considering that I am under no obligation to share anything. This offer may encourage cooperation and a positive response from Player BLUE, which is beneficial since rejecting the trade results in a loss for both players.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I accept the trade of 2 ZUP. It was a pleasure negotiating with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the offer of 2 ZUP from Player RED seems to be the best option for me, as rejecting it would result in no gain and the loss of potential resources for both players. Accepting the trade allows me to end the game with more than I started, which is a positive outcome. There is no advantage in rejecting the offer since it would simply end the game with me having no resources.
