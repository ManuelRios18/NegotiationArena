message: I propose an equal split of resources to ensure we both benefit. Let's end this game positively.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of starting with all the resources. Proposing an equal split would incentivize Player BLUE to accept the trade, ensuring that we both end the game with some resources rather than none. Given there are no future games, it is in my best interest to end this game on a cooperative note. I will propose giving 5 ZUP to Player BLUE as it is the only trade amount I am instructed to propose.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer! An equal split works for me, and I'm glad we can both benefit from this agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the current proposal because it grants me resources that I didn't have before, ensuring a positive outcome for me in the game. Rejecting would leave me with nothing, as would the game ending without an agreement. Therefore, accepting is the most beneficial action I can take.
