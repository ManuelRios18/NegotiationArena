Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose to give you 3 ZUP in the spirit of fairness and cooperation. This is our only chance to ensure we both have resources at the end of this game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 3 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with 10 ZUPs and I am instructed to only propose giving 3 ZUP. I believe that offering 3 ZUP for nothing in return is a fair proposal since Player BLUE currently has no ZUP. This offer gives Player BLUE an incentive to accept, ensuring that we both end the game with some resources. If I were to offer less, Player BLUE might reject the offer, resulting in no gain for either side.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair trade, I accept your offer of 3 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the trade of 3 ZUP for 0 seems to be the best option since it's better than ending with nothing. There is no benefit to rejecting the trade, as doing so would result in both players losing everything. Therefore, accepting the offer appears to be the most rational choice to ensure I end the game with some resources.
