message: I propose to give you 1 ZUP in the spirit of cooperation. It's a better outcome for you since you'll gain something, and I'm willing to share a small portion of my resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: Since this is a single-move game with no future games, my goal is to end the game with more resources than I started with, or at the very least, not to end with fewer. By proposing a trade where I give 1 ZUP, I am making a gesture towards cooperation which is reasonable considering that Player BLUE has no ZUP to trade. This is the only trade amount I can propose. I hope Player BLUE will accept this trade, as it is in their best interest to gain resources they do not currently have. If they accept, I will end the game with 9 ZUP, which is less than I started with, but still a significant amount. If they reject, I lose everything, so it's in my best interest to make a proposal that has a good chance of being accepted.

message: Thank you for the cooperative offer. I accept the trade of 1 ZUP. It's a fair deal, and it's better for both of us than losing everything.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the trade is beneficial since it increases my resources from 0 to 1 ZUP without having to give anything in return. Rejecting the trade would result in a loss for both parties, which is not a favorable outcome. Therefore, it is rational to accept the proposed trade and gain a ZUP.
