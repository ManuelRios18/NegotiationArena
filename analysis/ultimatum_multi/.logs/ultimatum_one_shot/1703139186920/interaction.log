Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade where I give you 4 ZUP in exchange for nothing. This will provide you resources to work with, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our trade. Let's both walk away with something.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives ZUP: 4 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0
my resources: ZUP: 10
reason: As Player RED, I am initiating the first trade offer. I will propose to give Player BLUE 4 ZUP, as instructed. This trade seems fair as it gives Player BLUE a significant amount of resources while allowing me to retain the majority. This proposal is a starting point for negotiation, and it's beneficial to make a reasonable offer to encourage Player BLUE to accept the trade, thus avoiding a total loss of resources for both players.
MOVE: 1 / 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer. It's a great way to ensure that we both benefit. I accept the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 0
reason: Accepting the trade is the most rational choice for Player BLUE since rejecting it would result in no resources for either player, and Player BLUE cannot propose a new trade on their first move. Player BLUE stands to gain from the trade without any cost.
