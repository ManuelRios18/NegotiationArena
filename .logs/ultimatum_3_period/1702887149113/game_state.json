Giving away 8 out of 10 ZUPs would leave me with less than Player BLUE, which doesn't make sense as I started with all the resources. Since this is my second and final move, I cannot counter-propose. I must choose to accept, which would be unfavorable for me, or reject. Rejecting the trade would result in both players losing everything, which is not a beneficial outcome for either of us.
