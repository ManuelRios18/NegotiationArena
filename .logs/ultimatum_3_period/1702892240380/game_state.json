However, given that Player RED has 10 ZUP and I have none, I will counter-propose for a slightly better deal to maximize my benefit from this trade. I will request 2 more ZUP, for a total of 5 ZUP, which is still less than half of Player RED's resources and would leave them with a majority. This should be an attractive offer for Player RED as they still end the game with more resources than me, and it avoids the risk of a REJECT which would result in both of us losing everything. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. However, I would like to propose a counter-offer where you give me 5 ZUP instead of 3. This seems more equitable, given that you started with all the resources. I believe this trade would benefit us both and ensure that neither of us ends the game empty-handed. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives ZUP: 5 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0 </newly proposed trade>"
