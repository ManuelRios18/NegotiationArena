This could be a negotiation tactic, or they might be trying to signal they are content with not engaging in any trade, which would mean they are willing to end the game without any resources. Since I cannot propose a new trade on my second move, I must decide whether to accept this non-offer or reject it. Accepting would keep the status quo, but rejecting would result in both players losing all their resources. Given that Player BLUE has no resources to lose and I have 10 ZUP, it is not in my best interest to reject.
