Given that Player RED has two moves and I only have one, it is in my best interest to make this counter-proposal on my only move. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> I appreciate your offer, Player RED, but I believe we can make this deal more beneficial for both of us. I would like to counter-propose that you give me 6 ZUP. This would still leave you with a significant amount of ZUP and ensure that we both walk away from this game with a positive outcome. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives ZUP: 6 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 0 </newly proposed trade>"
